        "body": "Related Story: Close encounters: Shedding light on South Australia's X-Files\n\nElon Musk already helps keep the lights on in South Australia -- but now he's lighting up the sky.\n\nAstute stargazers in Adelaide were last night shocked to spot a series of unidentified flying objects shining brightly in perfect alignment.\n\nABC Radio Adelaide listeners reported seeing the line of as many as 60 objects appearing in the night sky over different parts of the state at about 9:50pm.\n\nThe sightings were not confined to SA, however, with residents around other parts of the country including WA also witnessing the event.\n\n\"I looked up and I've never seen stars in a straight line before,\" one listener said.\n\n\"I thought 'what the heck's that?' and I suddenly realised they were moving.\"\n\nMaralinga whistleblower and Balaklava resident Avon Hudson said it was the \"most phenomenal thing\" he had witnessed \"after 50 years of watching the sky\".\n\nAnother listener was at South Plympton when he saw the objects \"moving at an incredible pace\".\n\n\"There's half a dozen ... satellites, planes, stars. They're very high up and there's like a convoy moving through the sky,\" he said.\n\n\"[It] went down from the middle of the night sky all the way to the coast and it went for a good four or five minutes.\"\n\nSocial media users also reported sightings of the strange phenomenon, with one saying they saw the high-speed objects while watching a star of a different kind in Adelaide's Botanic Park:\n\nSome wondered whether it was \"Santa doing a test run\" -- but an astronomer has revealed it was, in fact, Elon Musk's latest project.\n\nMr Musk -- whose Tesla battery near Jamestown provides vital back-up power to South Australia in the event of blackouts -- is the founder of SpaceX, which last month launched its latest round of satellites as part of its Starlink project.\n\nStarlink aims to offer broadband internet in the United States and Canada in 2020.\n\nIt has already launched more than 120 low-Earth-orbit satellites, with the most recent batch of 60 entering orbit last month.\n\n\"Starlink is a project to build a global network of satellites to provide Wi-Fi on the ground and so they fly essentially in a constellation,\" said Australian National University astrophysicist and astronomer Brad Tucker.\n\n\"[With] traditional satellites, you have to orbit the earth every 90 minutes so you can have gaps in satellite coverage.\n\n\"If you have a ring of satellites -- or a train or a convoy -- you don't have that gap.\n\n\"This is the very first project trying to do what we call constellation flying, or flying in rows.\"\n\nPerth Observatory also confirmed the lights were the work of SpaceX.\n\n\"Wondering what that train of bright objects flying over WA was tonight?\" it tweeted.\n\n\"They're SpaceX's Starlink satellites [which] will provide wireless internet around the world.\"\n\nDr Tucker said the same phenomenon had been spotted on Wednesday night in eastern parts of the country including Canberra, and would be visible there again tonight.\n\nHe said visibility of satellites had to do with their location in relation to both the earth and the sun.\n\n\"You see them as reflected sunlight,\" he said.\n\n\"You'll only see satellites about one to two hours after sunset and one to two hours before sunrise.\"\n\nWhile many were impressed by the display, Dr Tucker said Starlink raised potential problems for astronomers -- by blocking the view.\n\n\"They literally do get in the way of our photos ... if there are 40,000 swirling all over, we will not be able to image space from the ground,\" he said.\n\n\"You can do things [like] putting cameras on [satellites] to help with bushfire management which is another project, so you can see there's very big implications.\n\n\"But we don't want to sacrifice the ability to see space and understand what's going on.\"",

A block of thick bush, about 300 metres long and 50 metres deep, blew up at once. Flames over 100 metres tall licked the night sky.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald's chief photographer Nick Moir had been at the Green Wattle Creek fire, just south-west of Sydney, since 5.30pm on Thursday as it burned at emergency level and threatened homes. Three firefighters were flown to hospital from that fireground earlier in the day, suffering minor burns. Then at about 9pm, a swathe of bush instantly went up in flames.\n\n\"Firefighters at the scene agreed they had never seen anything like it,\" Moir said.\n\n\"It was simply an explosion of all of the bush being converted to raw energy. It was a massive roar. The sense immediately was just of intense heat. Myself, another Herald photographer Dean Sewell and the Rural Fire Service members just ran as fast as we could.\n\n\"The air was filled with heat and embers. Not just thousands but millions of them, stinging our faces in areas that weren't exposed. The radiant heat pushed everyone back, but spot fires and the embers swept through us as the winds increased to about 80 kilometres per hour.\n\n\"Immediately we retreated, counted our numbers, and established where our friends and other firefighters were as visibility dropped to metres.\"",

        "body": "The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nSatellites are becoming increasingly important in our lives, as they help us meet a demand for more data, exchanged at higher speeds. This is why we are exploring new ways of improving satellite communication.\n\nSatellite technology is used to navigate, forecast the weather, monitor Earth from space, receive TV signals from space, and connect to remote places through tools such as satellite phones and NBN's Sky Muster satellites.\n\nAll these communications use radio waves. These are electromagnetic waves that propagate through space and, to a certain degree, through obstacles such as walls.\n\nEach communication system uses a frequency band allocated for it, and each band makes up part of the electromagnetic spectrum - which is the name given to the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nBut the electromagnetic spectrum we are able to use with current technology is a finite resource, and is now completely occupied. This means old services have to make room for new ones, or higher frequency bands have to be used.\n\nWhile this poses technological challenges, one promising way forward is optical communication.\n\nCommunication with lasers\n\nInstead of using radio waves to carry the information, we can use light from lasers as the carrier. While technically still part of the electromagnetic spectrum, optical frequencies are significantly higher, which means we can use them to transfer data at higher speeds.\n\nRead more: Twisted light could dramatically boost internet speeds\n\nHowever, one disadvantage is that a laser cannot propagate through walls, and can even be blocked by clouds. While this is problematic on Earth, and for communication between satellites and Earth, it's no problem for communication between satellites.\n\nOn Earth, optical communication via fibre optic cables connects continents and provides enormous data exchanges. This is the technology that allows the cloud to exist, and online services to be provided.\n\nOptical communication between satellites doesn't use fibre optic cables, but involves light propagating through space. This is called \"free space optical communication\", and can be used to not only deliver data from satellites to the ground, but also to connect satellites in space.\n\nIn other words, free space optical communication will provide the same massive connectivity in space we already have on Earth.\n\nSome systems such as the European Data Relay System are already operational, and others like SpaceX's Starlink continue to be developed.\n\nBut there are still many challenges to overcome, and we're limited by current technology. My colleagues and I are working on making optical, as well as radio-frequency, data links even faster and more secure.\n\nCubeSats\n\nSo far, a lot of effort has gone into the research and development of radio-frequency technology. This is how we know data rates are at their highest physical limit and can't be further increased.\n\nWhile a single radio-frequency link can provide data rates of 10Gbps with large antennas, an optical link can achieve rates 10 to 100 times higher, using antennas that are 10 to 100 times smaller.\n\nThese small antennas are in fact optical lenses, and their compact size allows them to be integrated into small satellites called CubeSats.\n\nCubeSats are not larger than a shoebox or toaster, but can employ high speed data links to other satellites or the ground.\n\nThey are currently used for a wide range of tasks including earth observation, communications and scientific experiments in space. And while they're not able to provide all services from space, they play an important role in current and future satellite systems.\n\nRead more: The problems with small satellites - and what Australia's Space Agency can do to help\n\nAnother advantage of optical communication is increased security. The light from a laser forms a narrow beam, which has to be pointed from a sender to a receiver. Since this beam is very narrow, the communication doesn't interfere with other receivers and it's very hard, if not impossible, to eavesdrop on the communication. This makes optical systems more secure than radio electromagnetic systems.\n\nOptical communication can also be used for Quantum Key Distribution. This technology allows the absolute secure exchange of encryption keys for safe communications.\n\nWhat can we expect from this?\n\nWhile it's exciting to develop systems for space, and to launch satellites, the real benefit of satellite systems is felt on Earth.\n\nHigh speed communication provided by optical data links will improve connectivity for all of us. Notably, remote areas which currently have relatively slow connections will experience better access to remote health and remote learning.\n\nRead more: How new technologies are shaking up health care\n\nBetter data links will also let us deliver images and videos from space with less delay and higher resolution. This will improve the way we manage our resources, including water, agriculture and forestry.\n\nThey will also provide vital real-time information in disaster scenarios such as bushfires. The potential applications of optical communication technology are vast.\n\nBanding knowledge together\n\nWorking in optical satellite communication is challenging, as it combines many different fields and research areas including telecommunication, photonics and manufacturing.\n\nCurrently, our technology is far from achieving what is theoretically possible, and there's great room for improvement. This is why there's a strong focus on collaboration.\n\nIn Australia, there are two major programs facilitating this - the Australian Space Agency run by the federal government, and the SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre (CRC), also supported by the federal government.\n\nThrough the SmartSat CRC program, my colleagues and I will spend the next seven years tackling a range of applied research problems in this area.",

It's tough to see your golf ball when you're out there playing, where it finishes.\n\n\"Your eyes do burn up. I've got that cough like you've got something in your lungs, phlegm in your lungs or whatever, but it's not fun.\n\n\"I hope my kids are inside in the hotel room.\"\n\nJones said he had not encountered conditions as bad as those in Sydney when playing overseas.\n\n\"Even when I played in China, I didn't think it was like this at all,\" Jones said.\n\n\"Definitely not in Malaysia. It's just unbelievably humid [there]. I've never experienced something like this.\"\n\nAustralia's Cameron Smith, tied for sixth following a 3-under 68 in the first round, said he hoped the challenging conditions would not take too much of a toll ahead of next week's Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.\n\n\"I haven't really felt any different, it's just kind of the look. But we'll see after the four days, it might take a bit out of everyone, I'm sure.\"\n\nWith several sporting events cancelled this week as bushfires continue to rage all over New South Wales, children, the elderly and those with heart and lung conditions are most at risk.\n\nSt John Ambulance officials reported one asthma attack and \"plenty\" of people complaining of sore throats, stinging eyes and wheeziness among the galleries at the course.\n\nTournament officials were hoping forecast sea breezes would help clear skies by the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, two amateurs set the pace at the Australian Open in the first round, with Japan's Takumi Kanaya and Taiwan's Chun-An Yu atop the leaderboard after each posted a 6-under 65.\n\nSouth Africa's four-time major winner Ernie Els, who will captain the International Team at the Presidents Cup, could only manage a 1-over 72.\n\n2009 Australian Open champion Adam Scott had a horror day, having recorded a 4-over 75 in his opening round.",

        "body": "Bushfire watch 'off-guard'Warren HatelyAugusta Margaret River Times Thursday, 5 December 2019 7:29PM\n\nAn internal review has found WA's Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions was caught off-guard by changing weather conditions when three plantation fires escaped earlier this year.\n\nThe report also revealed the unexpected early winter bushfires on June 6 -- which occurred amid a rash of other fire incidents across the Capes -- happened while DBCA's extra firefighting resources were in traditional stand-down mode.\n\nThe findings have raised questions about the adequacy of emergency resources during non-peak bushfire periods.\n\nThe DBCA report, ordered to be released to the Times by Environment Minister Stephen Dawson, said the three fires escaped control while full-time and volunteer brigades were deployed across the Capes region fighting a number of other escaped burns fanned by fierce winds.\n\nThe report focused on management of three controlled burns undertaken by DBCA's Parks and Wildlife section, lit in May within Forest Product Commission plantations in Jarrahwood, Baudin and Vasse.\n\nThe report said a \"warm dry air mass sustained by strong winds in excess of 100km/h ... rekindled fire within smouldering log heaps, leading to firebrands being blown into post-harvest trash, with fire quickly spreading into adjacent native forest\".\n\nThe Jarrahwood fire burnt through the neighbouring settlement damaging uninsured fences, stock feed and a traffic bridge.\n\nOnly FPC assets were destroyed by the other fires.\n\nDespite a special inquiry into DBCA's handling of the Margaret River bushfires in 2011, among the key findings of the new report were to \"work with key fire practitioners to better understand and appreciate hazards, risk profile, and mitigation options\".\n\nThe review found \"significantly longer lead times\" were needed to meet planning time frames and approvals when reviewing burns on FPC land.\n\nWeather conditions also required \"greater and earlier consideration\" of available firefighting resources as well as \"planning and preparation for burn management and security\" to avoid repeat incidents.\n\nThe internal review also found DBCA and FPC did not have an \"agreed standard for preparation of second rotation burns, and a process for a formal handover and acceptance of the burns\".\n\nFuel loads and adjacent hardwood fuels must in future be \"properly considered to reduce subsequent risk\".\n\nThe agency was also instructed to \"work with (its) Fire Management Services branch and the Bureau of Meteorology to better understand possible impacts of weather forecasts on known existing fire loads located on and adjacent to department-managed lands.\"\n\nThe Parks and Wildlife service also had to \"work with Fire Management Services branch to identify additional resources external to the district or region that may be available to assist with the management of risk\".\n\nThe review found planning for the burns followed international standards, but did not take adjacent native bush into account.\n\nThere was also \"no evidence\" soil dryness and surface moisture measurements were considered.\n\nBefore the incident, DBCA officers alerted FPC to the likelihood of increased winds, undertook patrols and aerial surveillance, and suspended all other burns on May 29 because \"many of the heaps were re-igniting due to the drying conditions and a dry cold front\".\n\nRisk assessments of each site were undertaken in the days before June 6 and fire ground boundaries were secured, which was \"prudent and sound\", the report said.\n\n\"This period was also accompanied by an unprecedented spike in bushfire activity as a result of suspicious ignitions throughout May,\" it said. \"It is particularly unusual for DBCA personnel to be engaged in regular bushfire suppression at this time of the year.\"\n\nThe report also noted the weather pattern \"was like the previous year - and had not been recorded for 30 years prior to that\".\n\nFPC and the Department of Fire and Emergency Services were consulted in the review.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

        "body": "As a dangerous fire season looms, the Herald Sun can reveal some of the state's most experienced firefighters will be sidelined from spearheading integrated teams at out-of-control blazes because of an industrial agreement that was never approved.\n\nThe situation became apparent during last month's New South Wales fire emergency when a veteran CFA volunteer was dumped as the leader of a strike team sent to battle a bushfire around Grafton.\n\nThe crew was told Ray Dickson, a 40-year veteran, could not be in charge because there were paid firefighters in the team, and a career officer was given the job instead.\n\nVolunteer Fire Brigades Victoria chief Adam Barnett is demanding an investigation into the \"blatant overreach\" and \"appalling treatment\" of volunteers, as authorities brace for potentially disastrous conditions this summer after a dry winter.\n\nBut the CFA is standing firm because the Andrews Government is believed to have told it to implement operational changes included in a controversial pay deal that was never formalised by the Fair Work Commission.\n\nGovernment ministers and CFA chiefs had promised nothing would change for volunteers as Labor backed the union-friendly agreement and then restructured the state's fire services.\n\nVolunteers now fear community safety will be put at risk by the new leadership rules.\n\n\"In all emergency services, but especially in fire services, mixing operational doctrine with industrial side deals is a recipe for disaster,\" Mr Barnett said.\n\n\"We are heartbroken that a small number of individuals could even contemplate playing these petty and divisive power games during an active emergency.\"\n\nMr Dickson, who had led strike teams on numerous missions, said he was \"extremely disappointed\" the matter was not sorted out before he headed north.\n\n\"It could have been done a lot better. It did come out of the blue,\" he said when contacted by the Herald Sun.\n\nThere were no complaints about his replacement, and fire services sources said career and volunteer firefighters had worked alongside each other for years without chain-of-command issues during a bitter industrial dispute.\n\nA CFA spokeswoman said a career firefighter crew was \"erroneously allocated to a volunteer-led strike team\" in NSW.\n\n\"The matter was quickly resolved and the volunteer member continued to support the strike team from the command vehicle,\" she said.\n\nShe said CFA operational policy now dictated that \"a strike team leader who oversees a crew or crews of career firefighters must be a career firefighter\".\n\nThe spokeswoman said there was \"no significant departure from prior practice\" and added: \"These arrangements apply only to strike teams and do not apply to command arrangements at other everyday incidents.\"\n\nBut Mr Barnett said: \"We will seek action not only for Ray but to ensure this is never allowed to occur again.\"\n\nMORE NEWS\n\nHORRIFIC COBURG SEX ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS REVEALED\n\nJETSTAR STAFF IN STRIKE THREAT AHEAD OF PEAK SEASON\n\nPOLICE PLEAD WITH DRIVERS TO LEAVE PHONES ALONE\n\n\"Our work is dangerous enough without introducing any additional complexities,\" he said.\n\n\"Any terms or directives that lead to conflict, ambiguity or allow self-interest to be placed above that of protecting the public have no place in our emergency services.\"\n\n\"Any term or direction that can allow anyone to discriminate against volunteer firefighters or subjugate them to this appalling treatment should be denounced and withdrawn.\"\n\nEmergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said almost 2000 Victorian firefighters recently deployed interstate \"did an incredible job lending their service and expertise when and where it was needed most\".\n\nOpposition emergency services spokesman Brad Battin said volunteers were \"being treated like second class citizens\" by Labor.",

One hundred fires are burning across NSW, with 44 uncontained.\n\nThe appalling air pollution is set to continue with severe bushfire conditions across large chunks of the state.\n\nThe department says this season's bushfire emergency has caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen in NSW\".\n\nPollution levels are monitored by the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment's Air Quality Index. It measures several categories of particles. The one of most concern to public health is PM2.5.\n\nData and mapping from the department show PM2.5 levels have been above the 200 considered \"hazardous\" for weeks. In many cases the levels have been recorded above 600 in southern and western Sydney -- where millions of people live.\n\nThis morning the AQI for the Central Coast had skyrocketed past 1000.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says heavy smoke billowing from bushfires surrounding Sydney will linger in the city basin until Saturday.\n\nPoor air quality has again been forecast for Sydney after hazardous levels of pollution were recorded in the east and southwest of the city on Wednesday. Heavy smoke has been blowing into the city from a large fire near Warragamba Dam near the Blue Mountains, the NSW Rural Fire Service says.\n\n\"An overnight temperature inversion will trap the smoke in the Sydney basin. This means smoke will settle in many areas and be very heavy,\" the RFS said in a statement.\n\n\"Smoke is also affecting areas including the north coast, Central Coast, Hawkesbury, Wollondilly, Queanbeyan and Shoalhaven areas.\"\n\nThe NSW environment department says this season's bushfire emergency has caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen in NSW\".\n\n\"Recently NSW has experienced elevated levels of pollutants as a result of smoke from the bushfire emergency and dust caused by the severe drought,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"NSW has experienced other periods of poor air quality that lasted several weeks, including the 1994 Sydney bushfires and the Black Christmas bushfires of December 2001 to January 2002.\n\n\"This event, however, is the longest and the most widespread in our records.\"",

        "body": "Related Story: 'Hardest fire to fight': Homes lost as bushfires rip through Victoria's west\n\nElectricity provider Powercor has agreed to pay victims of one of the 2018 St Patrick's Day fires in south-west Victoria following the revelation of an \"explosive\" secret document.\n\nFour separate fires -- all caused by electricity infrastructure -- swept across the region in March last year, destroying homes, killing hundreds of livestock and burning more than 40,000 hectares of prime farm land.\n\nAlmost 200 people affected by The Sisters-Garvoc fire took Powercor and its maintenance subcontractor, Electrix, to the Supreme Court seeking an estimated $19 million in damages.\n\nDuring questioning in the case last week, Powercor maintenance chief Matthew Settle revealed the existence of a report, which detailed shortcomings in the energy provider's power pole maintenance program.\n\nIt highlighted an average of almost 40 pole failures a year across the state and concerns about wooden poles that were more than 50 years old.\n\nIt also showed unreported pole failures and failures yet to be investigated.\n\nThe defence counsel representing Powercor was ordered to present the report to court by 3:00pm last Friday.\n\nBy Tuesday, Powercor had asked to move the matter into mediation.\n\nThe civil case featured 189 plaintiffs seeking damages for insured and uninsured losses caused by the Garvoc-Sisters fire that began on March 17, 2018.\n\nEnergy Safe Victoria (ESV) found the fire was caused by a power pole that snapped in high winds due to \"decay and termite infestation\".\n\nESV's report said Powercor's inspection regime failed to identify that the pole was compromised.\n\n\"The pole had a sizeable internal cavity, caused by decay and termite infestation, which reduced its capacity to withstand the wind conditions,\" ESV wrote.\n\nIn October this year, ESV laid six charges against Powercor over the network failures that caused two of the four St Patrick's Day fires, including the Garvoc-Sisters blaze.\n\nThe matter will come to the Warrnambool Magistrates Court on January 20.\n\nFour class actions regarding the 2018 fires have begun against Powercor.\n\nIn one of those, a confidential settlement on a $3 million class action regarding the Terang fire was reached on October 25 -- the day after ESV laid charges over the blaze.\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide on December 9 whether or not to approve that settlement.\n\nGarvoc farmer and fire victim Jill Porter said the win would help with the district's recovery.\n\n\"It's a terrific outcome for the community that was impacted by that bushfire, in that it provides certainty and an opportunity now to move forward, to put the trauma and the suffering that that bushfire caused somewhat behind us,\" Ms Porter said.\n\n\"Without a doubt, we will celebrate. Everyday's a celebration, we survived a bushfire.\"\n\nShe said Powercor's secret report needed to be made public in the interest of public safety and as an important step in fixing Victoria's ageing power pole network.\n\n\"From what I heard in court, this report identifies extra care and extra inspection processes are needed,\" Ms Porter said.\n\n\"It seems apparent from the court hearing that the report shows Powercor knows that their own processes are inadequate and I think if Powercor knows that, it has a duty of care and responsibility.\"\n\nCounsel representing Electrix Dr Michael Rush QC told the court the maintenance document was not as \"explosive\" as the prosecution had made out.\n\n\"In relation to the 384 pole failures -- which has been referred to in the document that was discovered on Friday -- we are a bit concerned about this trial turning into a royal commission into pole failures around the state,\" Dr Rush said.\n\n\"Those pole failures have occurred over the last 10 years or so and it has been well known that there have been pole failures.\"",

Yeah I'm scared.\n\n\"My partner wanted to stay and he kept reassuring me -- I didn't think it would come to this.\"\n\nAnother local said: \"I'm a bit shaky at the moment. Being from Norway we pretty much have snow storms but nothing like this.\"\n\nA fire at Bangala Creek, in the area around the Cataract National Park near Tenterfield in the state's north is also burning at emergency level.\n\nThe RFS said the fire was spreading quickly in a north-easterly direction.\n\nThose in Paddys Flat and Pretty Gully who were unprepared are advised to leave now towards Tabulam.",

The company said the weather events have added to the company's struggle to find enough skilled workers in the region.\n\n\"Production at Maules Creek has also been affected by numerous unscheduled production stoppages during November and December from smoke, dust and haze events which are a function of ongoing severe drought conditions,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"With safety a key consideration, this has led to reduced truck speeds in lower visibility environments and in some cases required operations to be temporarily suspended.\"\n\nWhitehaven shares tumbled more than 9 per cent to a three-year low of $2.73 following the trading update on Thursday.",

Sydney could hit 34C today and Brisbane almost 40C as baking hot air is sucked in by westerlies from the interior.\n\nAcross the Nullarbor, Perth is also scorching and is looking at highs of 39C.\n\nThere are reports homes have been lost in Queensland's Darling Downs.\n\nSYDNEY'S \"HORRIFYING\" SUN\n\nSydneysiders have shared hundreds of images of yesterday's eerie sunset, calling the darkened skyline \"apocalyptic\" and \"horrifying\".\n\nYesterday, as thick smoke turned the sky a dark colour and the sun bright red, many took to social media to share photos of the unusual scenes.\n\n\"Horrifying today,\" one social media user wrote of the conditions.\n\n\"Hope you can breathe,\" another said.\n\nAs smoke from bushfires in the Blue Mountains continues to waft over Sydney, the particles effect the light coming through from the sun appearing to turn it a deep shade of orange or even red.\n\nThere are reports homes have been lost on the Darling Downs close to Toowoomba where fire crews have been unable to beat back a large bushfire, reported the Courier Mail.\n\nSevere fire warnings are in place for the state's southeast.\n\nRELATED: Heatwave conditions hit Queensland, Western Australia\n\n\"We're not sure of the number of properties that we've lost,\" Queensland Fire and Emergency Services Deputy Commissioner John Bolger told the ABC this morning.\n\nConditions are getting worse and any residents of Forest Ridge and nearby Cypress Gardens who remain have been told to leave immediately or follow their bushfire survival plan as 24 fire crews attempt to control the blaze.\n\n\"Fire crews are working to contain the fire, but firefighters may not be able to protect every property. You should not expect a firefighter at your door,\" the state's Rural Fire Service said on Thursday.\n\nPart of the Gore Highway has been closed between Cypress Gardens and the BP at Captains Mountain since Wednesday evening as the fire rages southwest of Millmerran, a town not far from Toowoomba.\n\nAn evacuation centre is now open at the Millmerran Showgrounds. A second significant fire is burning at Carneys Creek near the Queensland and New South Wales border, with people there being told to get ready to leave. Crews are fighting the fire on the ground and from the air.\n\n'LONGEST PERIOD' OF AIR POLLUTION\n\nSouth of the Tweed, fire danger ratings are \"very high\" as far south as the mid north coast and then a rung up at \"severe\" for the remainder of the coast including Sydney.\n\nA total fire ban is in place for much of eastern NSW including populated areas.\n\nHot and windy conditions could stoke blazes. One hundred fires are burning across NSW, with 44 uncontained.\n\nThe appalling air pollution is set to continue with severe bushfire conditions across large chunks of the state.\n\nThe department says this season's bushfire emergency has caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen in NSW\".\n\nPollution levels are monitored by the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment's Air Quality Index. It measures several categories of particles. The one of most concern to public health is PM2.5.\n\nData and mapping from the department show PM2.5 levels have been above the 200 considered \"hazardous\" for weeks. In many cases the levels have been recorded above 600 in southern and western Sydney -- where millions of people live.\n\nThis morning the AQI for the Central Coast had skyrocketed past 1000.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says heavy smoke billowing from bushfires surrounding Sydney will linger in the city basin until Saturday.\n\nPoor air quality has again been forecast for Sydney after hazardous levels of pollution were recorded in the east and southwest of the city on Wednesday. Heavy smoke has been blowing into the city from a large fire near Warragamba Dam near the Blue Mountains, the NSW Rural Fire Service says.\n\n\"An overnight temperature inversion will trap the smoke in the Sydney basin. This means smoke will settle in many areas and be very heavy,\" the RFS said in a statement.\n\n\"Smoke is also affecting areas including the north coast, Central Coast, Hawkesbury, Wollondilly, Queanbeyan and Shoalhaven areas.\"\n\nThe NSW environment department says this season's bushfire emergency has caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen in NSW\".\n\n\"Recently NSW has experienced elevated levels of pollutants as a result of smoke from the bushfire emergency and dust caused by the severe drought,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"NSW has experienced other periods of poor air quality that lasted several weeks, including the 1994 Sydney bushfires and the Black Christmas bushfires of December 2001 to January 2002.\n\n\"This event, however, is the longest and the most widespread in our records.\"",

        "body": "The Gospers Mountain bushfire threatening Sydney's north-west and Hawkesbury, and the out of control Green Wattle Creek fire in Sydney's south-west have been upgraded to emergency warnings.\n\nResidents in Colo Heights and Upper Colo are being urged to leave now, as the Gospers Mountain fire is burning more than 232,000 hectares.\n\nThe Green Wattle Creek fire has jumped Lake Burragorang at Warragamba Dam and the RFS has advised residents in Nattai and Oakdale to leave now.\n\nThe RFS has said today will be \"challenging\" for firefighters in the Central Coast as the Three Mile bushfire continues to burn out of control.\n\nBy 1pm, there were 112 fires burning across NSW, with 56 yet to be contained.\n\nThe winds will also leave Sydney covered in smoke for yet another day, as the conditions are likened to smoking 20 cigarettes a day.\n\nOn Thursday morning there were 1600 NSW Rural firefighters on the ground battling blazes, with more than 2000 expected to work by the end of the day. Volunteers from Canada who have given up their Christmas holiday to help fight Australia's bushfires have touched down in Sydney today, and are expected to give some much needed support to the Aussie fireys.\n\nSpecial attention will be given to the Three Mile fire on the Central Coast, Gospers Mountain fire at Hawkesbury and Currowan fire at Shoalhaven on the south coast.\n\nTemperatures are tipped to reach 31 degrees, 34 degrees and 32 degrees in those areas respectively, with high wind gusts pushing the fires east.\n\n\"These fires could make a very big run in an easterly direction today,\" a NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman said.\n\n\"We are seeing a severe fire danger in that area with temperatures in the high 30s and wind gusts in the 70kmh in a number of areas.\n\n\"We will keep an eye on these fires because they are likely to burn in and around the townships in those areas.\"\n\nThe \"longest period\" of air pollution on record for NSW is also set to continue.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology said heavy smoke billowing from bushfires surrounding Sydney would linger in the city basin until Saturday.\n\nPoor air quality has been forecast for Sydney after hazardous levels of pollution were recorded in the east and southwest of the city on Wednesday.\n\nHeavy smoke has been blowing into the city from a large fire near Warragamba Dam near the Blue Mountains, the NSW Rural Fire Service says.\n\n\"An overnight temperature inversion will trap the smoke in the Sydney basin. This means smoke will settle in many areas and be very heavy,\" the RFS said in a statement.\n\n\"Smoke is also affecting areas including the north coast, Central Coast, Hawkesbury, Wollondilly, Queanbeyan and Shoalhaven areas.\"\n\nThe NSW environment department says this season's bushfire emergency has caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen in NSW\".\n\n\"Recently NSW has experienced elevated levels of pollutants as a result of smoke from the bushfire emergency, and dust caused by the severe drought,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"NSW has experienced other periods of poor air quality that lasted several weeks, including the 1994 Sydney bushfires and the Black Christmas bushfires of December 2001 to January 2002.\n\n\"This event, however, is the longest and the most widespread in our records.\"\n\nThe NSW Rural Fire service has issued widespread total fire bans for Thursday, with hot and windy conditions expected to worsen across the state.\n\nOriginally published as 'Leave now': Fireys battle major bushfires near Sydney",

        "body": "MARK MORROW: We've got fire pumps, we've got a dam with thousands and thousands of gallons of water.\n\nWe've got bore water, we've got everything.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY, REPORTER: Retired firefighter Mark Morrow is preparing for the fire season ahead.\n\nHe lives with his partner Deb near Kinglake in Victoria.\n\nTen years after Black Saturday the memories of that day are still vivid.\n\nMARK MORROW: When the wind changed, we knew we were in trouble.\n\nDEB MORROW: The whole mountain was on fire. I was in absolute terror. It was terror.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: The Royal Commission into Black Saturday found the fire that destroyed their home, started when an electrical wire failed and caused arcing.\n\nMARK MORROW: Every time it arced, it spewed out plasma at 5,000 degrees Celsius. So, what's that going to do when it hits the grass below it?\n\nWhat hope have you got?\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: Of the 173 people who were killed in the Black Saturday fires, 159 died in fires started by powerlines.\n\nDR KEVIN TOLHURST, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY: 80 per cent of life loss since 1977, has been associated with fire started by powerline.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: In 2010, the Royal Commission recommended insulating powerlines or putting them underground.\n\nA task force began looking into these options as well as a technology called REFCL - a Rapid Earth Fault Current Limiter.\n\nREFCL works like a big safety switch, rapidly defecting powerline faults and reducing the power flowing through the faulty line.\n\nThese tests show how it works.\n\nA powerline hits the ground with no REFCL installed, a fire starts.\n\nTest 158 with the REFCL device installed on the network. There is no fire.\n\nDR TONY MARXSEN, MARXSEN CONSULTING: I have watched hundreds of ignition tests where live conductors have fallen into beds of ultra-dry grass under very hot conditions. And in not one of\n\nthose tests, if a REFCL was in service, did a fire start.\n\nSo it works.\n\nDR BILL CARMAN, ELECTRICAL RISK CONSULTANT: The REFCL can only manage a number of incidents and even under the best conditions, they can actually fail to operate in certain cases. So we were quite worried.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: REFCLs aren't the only technology that has been installed on Victoria's power network to reduce bushfire risk.\n\nBut some powerline safety experts say, there are big questions about its effectiveness.\n\nDR BILL CARMAN: Even from the start, I was concerned. I could see that it would look like a panacea but I knew that it could not actually control all the risk associated with electrical assets.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: Here is what happens when REFCL goes wrong.\n\nWhen the REFCL device shuts off the power on a faulty wire, the voltage can almost double on the other wires, putting stress on the entire network.\n\nThis means, they can potentially create secondary faults known as cross country faults, elsewhere on the network.\n\nWhen you saw that the first time, what did you think?\n\nDR BILL CARMAN: I was expecting to see it, because I was looking for cross country faults. It's something I know about. If you have a cross country fault you are most likely to get a fire start.\n\nOnce there is a cross country fault, you actually have a fault at two different locations and so the current is released at both of those locations so there's a -- you could say there is a safety risk.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: The REFCL manufacturer, Swedish Neutral says the product does not cause other faults on the networks it operates on. Dr Tony Marxsen is the former chairman of the Energy Market\n\nOperator and says these types of faults are rare.\n\nDR TONY MARXSEN: It's not a stress caused by the REFCL. The first REFCL went in two-years-ago and no cross country faults.\n\nSo -- they are a fact of life. They are rare. They do happen. If they do happen they pose risk. But it's not necessarily catastrophic risk.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: As well as serving on the taskforce that was bringing in the REFCLs, Dr Marxsen was also appointed to oversee any objections.\n\nIsn't that a clear conflict of interest?\n\nDR TONY MARXSEN: No, I don't believe so. I gave my advice on those objections and the Government made a decision.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: REFCLs have never been used anywhere in the world for the purpose of bushfire protection.\n\nThe expected cost of Victoria's REFCL program was $150 million.\n\nSo far that's blown out to about $650 million.\n\nJOHN BRADLEY, VIC DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT: The package that was delivered, ends up being around 30 to 60 times less expensive, than the alternative ways of achieving that critical protection of the community.\n\nSo I think it's money well spent, although we are having some teething problems in the implementation.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: As the REFCL program was being rolled out across the state in western Victoria, communities were devastated by yet another fire started by a powerline.\n\nJILL PORTER: I run around our house and our farm, so every morning you are reminded of where the fire's been and you look at the regeneration and the moving forward.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: The St Patrick's Day fires in March 2018, destroyed Jill Porter's farm at the Sisters in western Victoria.\n\nJILL PORTER: Takes a long time to breed a herd of cattle. It also takes a long time to remove the images of those cattle that you see being burnt.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: The fire started when a power pole on a neighbouring farm collapsed.\n\nJill Porter says REFCL devices could not have prevented any of the six fires that started that day.\n\nJILL PORTER: I don't think REFCL is the answer. I don't think REFCL will keep us safe.\n\nPAUL FEARON, DIRECTOR ENERGY SAFE VIC: We always understood this was potentially highly prospective technology but was in need of very significant development work. So it was a journey of discovery.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: Are you confident that REFCLs are safe?\n\nPAUL FEARON: I am very confident that they are safe.\n\nMore than that, they represent a very significant improvement in the bushfire safety for this state.\n\nLIZ HOBDAY: The poles and wires companies, Power Core and AusNet Services, both say they have tested REFCLs comprehensively and the devices worked during last week's high fire risk weather.\n\n10 years after Black Saturday, like the rest of regional Victoria, dairy farmer Jill Porter is facing another fire season.\n\nJILL PORTER: You are on edge all the time. As soon as the wind picks up, as soon as the temperature picks up, as soon as the grass dries out. It's fear. And terror. And just anticipation of what are we going to cop.",

        "body": "LEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: Sue Ashton, everybody is so sad about Lewis the Koala dying. Thank you very much for all the work you are doing up there. His injuries were too much at the end, were they?\n\nSUE ASHTON, PORT MACQUARIE KOALA HOSPITAL: Yes, they were. We knew when he was rescued and came into the Koala Hospital that his burns were extensive and right from the start, we said his prognosis was guarded. We did our very best for him. We gave him a lot of love and a lot of attention but unfortunately it became an animal welfare issue.\n\nWe wouldn't keep him alive if his quality of lifelong term, wasn't going to be worth living.\n\nLEIGH SALES: And the woman who rescued him was able to come in and say goodbye?\n\nSUE ASHTON: Yes, Tony Doherty who rescued him in the fire was able to come into the Koala Hospital and said goodbye before we actually euthanased him.\n\nLEIGH SALES: How many koala's are you caring for at the moment as a result of the bushfires?\n\nSUE ASHTON: As a result of the bushfires, we have got 33 koalas in the hospital with varying degrees and severity of burns. Some are quite badly burnt and they're being monitored very carefully in our intensive care units. Some are relatively unscathed and they are in outdoor enclosures and doing quite well.\n\nLEIGH SALES: When will you release them given how much of their habitat has the been destroyed?\n\nSUE ASHTON: Our goal at the Koala Hospital is to always put koala's back to where they came from because they live in populations and in quite distinct areas. These guys, when they have been rescued we monitor exactly where they have come. From they will stay with us for six to nine months until their habitat restores and we will release them back almost exactly in the same tree as they were rescued from.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Can you give some broader context, what is the situation facing koala's generally in Australia at the moment?\n\nSUE ASHTON: We are very concerned about the plight of the koalas and what's going to happen to this lovely iconic Australian. With all over these fires and the number that have been wiped out, hundreds and hundreds, maybe even close to thousands.\n\nIt is going to take a long time for these wild animals to recover from that. They breed about every 18 months to two years, if you're lucky. To lose hundreds in just a two-week period you can imagine how long it is going to take to rebuild those populations.\n\nLEIGH SALES: How surprised are you at how much attention Lewis' case has garnered here in Australia and around the world?\n\nSUE ASHTON: Absolutely overwhelmed. We had no idea it would generate so much interest. For the Koala Hospital it has been absolutely wonderful but also for koalas. It has brought them front and centre and they deserve to be. They're just wonderful little creatures.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Has the attention translated into donations and support?\n\nSUE ASHTON: Yes, yes, our GoFundMe account - which we set up to build wildlife water stations and also to establish a wild koala breeding program - which will be the first in the world, went way past our goal which was $25,000.\n\nIt's almost $1.75 million. And we had no idea it would reach anything like that.\n\nA lot of donations too have been coming in small amounts like $10 and $20 which shows how widespread the interest is in koalas\n\nLEIGH SALES: Thank you for everything you do and thank you for making time to speak to our viewers tonight.",

        "body": "On April 10, just months after Israel Folau signed a lucrative new multi-season contract with Rugby Australia, he made a decision that would change his life.\n\nBy that point in his career, Folau had already caused a stir on social media.\n\nThe 30-year-old had grown up as a Mormon but became an active member of an Assemblies of God fellowship in 2011.\n\nIt was then that he changed his Twitter profile to say \"Living for Jesus Christ #TeamJesus\" and began posting increasingly fundamentalist views.\n\nThe first sign of trouble was in April 2018 when Folau posted that gay people were destined for hell and tweeted a link to a video opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nRugby Australia, which has a policy of inclusiveness, reprimanded him after a fierce public backlash.\n\nFor a year after that it seemed the telling-off had done the job.\n\nBut, on April 10, Folau spectacularly reignited the controversy when he took to Instagram and posted a banner that read: \"Drunks, Homosexuals, Adulterers, Liars, Fornicators, Thieves, Atheists, Idolators: Hell Awaits You. Repent! Only Jesus Saves.\"\n\nThe day after, Rugby Australia announced it would terminate Folau's contract, and the following month he was found guilty of breaching the sporting body's code of conduct.\n\nWith key Wallabies sponsor Qantas livid and criticism building, Rugby Australia sensationally sacked Folau for breach of contract on May 17.\n\nStanding defiant, Folau launched his legal fight against his disimissal in June and made a GoFundMe page to fund his fees.\n\nThis page was shut down later that month, but the Australian Christian Lobby began a new campaign the following day.\n\nSpeaking to Alan Jones shortly after, Folau said Rugby Australia offered him money to take his social media post down, a claim the body denied.\n\nWith Folau demanding $10 million in compensation, the sportsman and Rugby Australia failed to reach an agreement in a conciliation meeting on June 28.\n\nIt was around this time that the Wallabies - who Folau had been one of the star players for -- were gearing up for the Rugby World Cup in Japan.\n\nHowever, the headlines in the months leading up to the tournament were dominated by Folau and his social media posts.\n\nIn Japan, the Wallabies exited in the quarter-finals following a humiliating 40-16 loss to England.\n\nRugby Australia chief executive Raelene Castle said the storm around Folau was a distraction for the team.\n\n\"I certainly don't think it's helpful,\" she told ABC's Radio National.\n\n\"I think when you've got a player who chooses to put their views in front of the views of the team and we end up with headlines and people writing things about Rugby Australia as opposed to writing about the rugby, that's never helpful. Of course it's not.\"\n\nFolau continued to provoke outrage in the weeks that followed. On November 17 he said the catastrophic bushfires that had ravaged Queensland and NSW were \"God's punishment\" for Australia allowing same-sex marriage and abortion.\n\nTen days later he upped his demands from Rugby Australia, asking for $14 million over the termination of his contract.\n\nAnd now, eight months after he hit send on that infamous Instagram post, Folau and Rugby Australia signed a confidential settlement, estimated to be up to $8 million.\n\nThis agreement came after mediation ordered by the Federal Circuit Court had gone for a marathon 12 hours on Monday, then wrapped up over the phone on Wednesday.\n\nWith his wife Maria by his side, Folau later published a video statement on his website.\n\n\"With today's acknowledgment and apology by Rugby Australia, we have been vindicated and can now move on with our lives to focus on our faith and our family,\" Folau said on Wednesday.\n\n\"We now look forward to the federal government enacting the legislation necessary to further protect and strengthen these rights for all Australians.\"",

However, there have been more DFES management staff and support brought to the area to assist emergency services volunteers and the Shire of Esperance.\"\n\nRoe MLA Peter Rundle said that Mr Logan's \"knee-jerk\" reaction was premature.\n\n\"Esperance is very isolated, you've got Albany and Kalgoorlie, and Esperance would be a logical part of the triangle,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's disappointing that he's ruled it out without that consultation and I'll be talking to the Minister when I get back to Parliament for sure.\n\nThere are 16 volunteer brigades and 28 fire appliances in the Esperance region, as well as an emergency support unit which can act as an Incident Control Vehicle.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

Sydney could hit 34C today and Brisbane almost 40C as baking hot air is sucked in by westerlies from the interior.\n\nSydneysiders have shared hundreds of images of yesterday's eerie sunset, calling the darkened skyline \"apocalyptic\" and \"horrifying\".\n\nYesterday, as thick smoke turned the sky a dark colour and the sun bright red, many took to social media to share photos of the unusual scenes.\n\n\"Horrifying today,\" one social media user wrote of the conditions.\n\n\"Hope you can breathe,\" another said.\n\nAs smoke from bushfires in the Blue Mountains continues to waft over Sydney, the particles effect the light coming through from the sun appearing to turn it a deep shade of orange or even red.\n\nThere are reports homes have been lost on the Darling Downs close to Toowoomba where fire crews have been unable to beat back a large bushfire, reported the Courier Mail.\n\nSevere fire warnings are in place for the state's southeast.\n\nRELATED: Heatwave conditions hit Queensland, Western Australia\n\n\"We're not sure of the number of properties that we've lost,\" Queensland Fire and Emergency Services Deputy Commissioner John Bolger told the ABC this morning.\n\nConditions are getting worse and any residents of Forest Ridge and nearby Cypress Gardens who remain have been told to leave immediately or follow their bushfire survival plan as 24 fire crews attempt to control the blaze.\n\n\"Fire crews are working to contain the fire, but firefighters may not be able to protect every property. You should not expect a firefighter at your door,\" the state's Rural Fire Service said on Thursday.\n\nPart of the Gore Highway has been closed between Cypress Gardens and the BP at Captains Mountain since Wednesday evening as the fire rages southwest of Millmerran, a town not far from Toowoomba.\n\nAn evacuation centre is now open at the Millmerran Showgrounds. A second significant fire is burning at Carneys Creek near the Queensland and New South Wales border, with people there being told to get ready to leave. Crews are fighting the fire on the ground and from the air.\n\n'LONGEST PERIOD' OF AIR POLLUTION\n\nSouth of the Tweed, fire danger ratings are \"very high\" as far south as the mid north coast and then a rung up at \"severe\" for the remainder of the coast including Sydney.\n\nA total fire ban is in place for much of eastern NSW including populated areas.\n\nHot and windy conditions could stoke blazes. One hundred fires are burning across NSW, with 44 uncontained.\n\nThe appalling air pollution is set to continue with severe bushfire conditions across large chunks of the state.\n\nThe department says this season's bushfire emergency has caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen in NSW\".\n\nPollution levels are monitored by the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment's Air Quality Index. It measures several categories of particles. The one of most concern to public health is PM2.5.\n\nData and mapping from the department show PM2.5 levels have been above the 200 considered \"hazardous\" for weeks. In many cases the levels have been recorded above 600 in southern and western Sydney -- where millions of people live.\n\nThis morning the AQI for the Central Coast had skyrocketed past 1000.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says heavy smoke billowing from bushfires surrounding Sydney will linger in the city basin until Saturday.\n\nPoor air quality has again been forecast for Sydney after hazardous levels of pollution were recorded in the east and southwest of the city on Wednesday. Heavy smoke has been blowing into the city from a large fire near Warragamba Dam near the Blue Mountains, the NSW Rural Fire Service says.\n\n\"An overnight temperature inversion will trap the smoke in the Sydney basin. This means smoke will settle in many areas and be very heavy,\" the RFS said in a statement.\n\n\"Smoke is also affecting areas including the north coast, Central Coast, Hawkesbury, Wollondilly, Queanbeyan and Shoalhaven areas.\"\n\nThe NSW environment department says this season's bushfire emergency has caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen in NSW\".\n\n\"Recently NSW has experienced elevated levels of pollutants as a result of smoke from the bushfire emergency and dust caused by the severe drought,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"NSW has experienced other periods of poor air quality that lasted several weeks, including the 1994 Sydney bushfires and the Black Christmas bushfires of December 2001 to January 2002.\n\n\"This event, however, is the longest and the most widespread in our records.\"",

Please consider supporting our journalism with a subscription.\n\nFirefighters are battling two bushfire emergencies unfolding on the outskirts of Sydney on Thursday, with residents in parts of the Hawkesbury and south-west of Warragamba Dam told it's time to evacuate if they aren't staying to defend their homes.\n\nThe Green Wattle Creek fire burning in the Wollondilly area, south-west of Warragamba, has crossed Lake Burragorang and is quickly spreading east towards Nattai and Oakdale. Residents in Nattai are advised to seek shelter as the fire approaches.\n\nOn the southern flank of the massive 232,000-hectare Gospers Mountain blaze, residents in Colo Heights and Upper Colo are being told to evacuate now towards Wilberforce if they aren't staying to fight the fire, while those in Boree and Wallabadah are advised that leaving early is their safest option.\n\nGreater Sydney is among nine NSW regions subject to total fire bans on Thursday amid fears many more homes could come under threat from multiple bushfires burning under \"severe\" fire danger conditions.",

If you do not have a plan, or intend to leave, you should be ready to leave the area because the situation could get worse quickly.\n\nPeople in the area will be affected by smoke, which will reduce visibility and air quality.\n\nCall triple-0 immediately if you believe your property is under threat.\n\nUPDATE, 11.30AM: Toowoomba Mayor Paul Antonio says work undertaken by firefighters today will be \"critical\" in containing the Cyprus Gardens fire.\n\n\"It really depends on weather conditions, that's the big problem,\" the Mayor said.\n\nCr Antonio said roughly 50 people spent the night at an evacuation centre at the Millmerran Showgrounds, and there were still about 30 people there today.\n\n\"Once again you've seen the community of Millmerran all come together in an effort to help those in need, it's really quite amazing what I've seen,\" he said.\n\nCr Antonio said the community had brought mattresses, blankets, pillows, food and more to the showgrounds to support those who had to evacuate.\n\n\"The whole community came together,\" he said.\n\n\"The Lions Club covered themselves in glory when they did the cooking, the local hospital was involved.\"\n\nCr Antonio said the council's priority today, as it was in any emergency, was to \"protect life\".\n\n\"Our staff have been doing such an amazing job, as have QFES and the other agencies.\"\n\nThe fire is also threatening some of Cr Antonio's cattle properties.\n\n\"It's fair to say some of our country is very much in the fire line if it breaks out,\" he said.\n\n\"We are managing that now, getting our livestock out of timber country and into open country, protecting the houses.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking, I find it very hard.\"\n\nCyprus Gardens fire: Millmerran resident John Rogers shared this footage of the Cyprus Gardens fire.\n\nDarling Downs Public Health Unit Director Dr Penny Hutchinson said with smoke from a bushfire near Millmerran affecting some communities in the region, residents were urged to take precautions and minimise exposure to smoke.\n\n\"Increased amounts of smoke and particulates from ash in the air due to bushfires can pose risks for some members of the community,\" said Darling Downs Public Health Unit Director Dr Penny Hutchinson.\n\n\"The groups most at risk are the elderly, the very young, and people with existing medical conditions, such as asthma, heart disease and other lung or respiratory illnesses.\"\n\nDr Hutchinson said anyone taking medications for these conditions should keep them close by and be vigilant in taking their medications.\n\n\"If people with asthma experience symptoms due to exposure to smoke we recommend following their asthma management plan, but if they do so and they still experience symptoms they should seek medical advice immediately,\" she said.\n\n\"Anyone experiencing breathing difficulty should call triple-zero and seek urgent medical assistance.\"\n\nDr Hutchinson said the most effective way to avoid exposure to smoke was to stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed.\n\n\"If air conditioning is available it's advisable to have it on a recycle or recirculating setting,\" Dr Hutchinson said.\n\n\"This may not be possible, particularly for people without air conditioning during hot conditions, so in this case another option is to seek an alternative air-conditioned location for the day, such as a local library or shopping centre.\"\n\nAnyone with concerns can call 13HEALTH (13 43 25 84) for health advice and assistance 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nA leave now notice remains in place for Cypress Gardens and Forest Ridge.\n\nUPDATE, 8.45AM: THERE are fears properties have been lost to a fast-moving bushfire on Queensland's Darling Downs.\n\nThe large fire, near Millmerran west of Toowoomba, sparked evacuations yesterday.\n\nIt's continuing to burn near Cypress Gardens and Forest Ridge. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services Deputy Commissioner John Bolger says there are unconfirmed reports that two structures have been lost but it's not known if they are sheds or houses.\n\n\"We're not sure of the number of properties that we've lost,\" he has told the ABC.\n\n\"But we'll have aircraft up and ground crews as soon as it's safe to get in there and assess any damage.\"\n\nCypress Gardens local Douglas Grist, who said he believed homes may have been lost to the blaze, fled to the community centre with his dog, Shadow.\n\n\" ... I was really worried about my property,\" Douglas Grist told The Courier-Mail yesterday.\n\n\"My house was probably about one kilometre away from the fire (but) I went to check at about 6.30pm and the winds must have changed because it was safe.\"\n\nThe fire danger remains severe today, with Queensland's southeast experiencing very hot conditions this week.\n\nA watch-and-act warning remains in place for residents of Cypress Gardens and Forest Ridge. People who don't have a bushfire plan have been advised to leave.\n\nThose who left on Wednesday have been told it's not safe to return, with an evacuation centre is open at the Millmerran Showgrounds.\n\nPart of the Gore Highway remains closed between Cypress Gardens and the BP at Captains Mountain.\n\nA second fire significant fire is burning at Carneys Creek near the Queensland and New South Wales Border, with people there being told to get ready to leave.\n\nCrews are fighting the fire on the ground and from the air.",

If we get another bushfire, that's the only consolation of it all.\n\n\"Once it's burned it won't burn twice -- as long as you don't get burnt the first time.\"\n\nThere have been six fires of significance over the past two weeks in East Gippsland.\n\nAuthorities were most concerned about fires near Gelantipy, Bruthen, and Ensay.\n\nThe fires were caused by dry lightning that ignited dozens of fires along the Great Dividing Range.\n\nIncident controller Andy Gillham said the Country Fire Authority and DELWP were not caught off-guard by the fires.\n\n\"With all the modelling that has been done by the fire researchers, they said it would be an above-average season for East Gippsland,\" he said.\n\n\"Because the landscape is so dry we had lightning and fires. We did have an early start to the season, but we weren't caught off-guard.\n\n\"We were expecting it, we were just hoping it didn't happen.\"\n\nMr Gillham said communities in East Gippsland should treat the recent fires as a practice run for the season.\n\n\"Yeah it's a cruel use of phrase 'practice run', isn't it?\" he said.\n\n\"The focus is definitely going to be on East Gippsland and up the east coast of Australia.\n\n\"What firefighters are saying is, we are expecting an average season across most of Victoria, so that's the areas north and west of Melbourne.\n\n\"But for East Gippsland the message is very clear and concise and loud: above average, it's going to be a very busy, active, long fire season.\"\n\nSue Gray lives with her husband at Reedy Flat, on a 404-hectare property east of Ensay.\n\nTheir property was not damaged by the nearby fire, but Ms Gray said she could see the flames from her house.\n\nMs Gray said the heat from the fire caused her livestock to run into a nearby creek for shelter. A small amount of recent rain meant the creek was running again, but she said that would not last long.\n\nShe said if another fire came close, they may not have enough water to fight it.\n\n\"We hope we've got water here to keep everything damp, but it all depends on the creek,\" she said.\n\n\"So it's going to be hard. We'd probably have to leave if [another fire] got too close.\"\n\nThe fire near Ensay was at its most ferocious on the night of Monday, November 25.\n\nKerry Geehman lives at Ensay North, where she farms and works at the local pub.\n\n\"You just knew there was a fire there,\" she said.\n\n\"A lot of people get a bit agitated, but we were just 'let's see what happens'. So I suppose we were calm, because it's not good getting upset, because then you're useless if something does happen.\"\n\nMs Geehman said now that these fires had occurred, it was likely there would be more.\n\n\"Living in the bush, this is what's going to happen. You just sort of go with the flow -- that's me.\"\n\nWorking at the local pub, Ms Geehman had an insight into how the community was coping.\n\n\"I think all are probably a bit the same as me. We have an older community, but that's actually a good thing because they've been through this before. So a lot of people are really fire-savvy. They'll know when to stay or go.\n\n\"I think it's just a wait and see thing, we'll wait and see what happens.\"\n\nIncident controller Andy Gillham said if people did not already have a bushfire survival plan, now was the time to make one.\n\n\"This was, in a way, a bit of test run for your fire plan,\" he said.\n\n\"Remember this is not a normal season -- this is an unusually active and dry season.\"",

        "body": "Cloth masks are a popular choice -- but they're effectively useless against the particles in bushfire smoke.\n\nWaking up to a haze of smoke is becoming an eerily familiar sight to people across the country.\n\nThis week, Sydney is again blanketed in smog thanks to the spate of bushfires burning across NSW, and last month the Queensland fire emergency left Brisbane's air quality worse than Beijing.\n\nMany Australians in outer-suburban, regional and rural areas have been contending with bushfire smoke and dust for weeks.\n\nThe health effects of poor and hazardous air quality are real, and already being felt.\n\nBushfire smoke is known to irritate the respiratory system, and contains fine particles that can travel deep into the lungs, causing damage.\n\nWhile most healthy people can tolerate temporary exposure air pollution (though it may cause itchy eyes and throat irritation), smoke particles can aggravate existing heart and lung conditions -- and put vulnerable people at risk.\n\nThe best way to avoid breathing in bushfire smoke is stay inside with the windows and doors closed.\n\nBut when we step outside, are face masks worth considering? We asked the experts.\n\n\"Facemasks are the least useful measure, as a public health response,\" said Fay Johnston from the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research.\n\n\"There's only one sort that actually helps -- that's the P2 masks. They're the only ones that can filter out a meaningful level of air pollution.\"\n\nRespiratory protective equipment -- the dust masks and respirators you might see builders or landscapers using -- are rated by their level of particle protection. P1 devices provide low levels of dust protection, while P2 masks are better at filtering out particles.\n\nYou can buy them from hardware stores, but they need to fit correctly to be effective.\n\n\"They only work with a really airtight seal that you have to maintain -- if you're a man with a beard, it's impossible. And if air leaks around the sides you might as well not have one,\" Dr Johnston said.\n\nWhile cloth and paper masks can stop aerosols and water droplets -- which may in some cases be helpful for preventing the spread of infections -- they don't filter well enough to be of use against the microscopic dust particles that make bushfire smoke dangerous, she said.\n\nProfessor of Global Health at the Australian National University, Sotiris Vardoulakis, agreed.\n\n\"They're not designed for pollution. They're are not very effective at removing particles from the air stream ... they don't fit properly around the face, there's a lot of leakage,\" he said.\n\nA British study published last year found the face masks used by residents of Beijing to protect against that city's high levels of air pollution did very little.\n\n\"[Even] a mask with highly efficient particle-filtering material may confer little protection when worn,\" the authors wrote, in part because the masks often fit poorly and moved around while they were strapped to someone's face.\n\nAn air purifier in the home can offer some relief, Dr Johnston said, though shoppers should be careful they're getting something that works.\n\n\"You need to check it's got a HEPA filter -- there's a lot of things sold as air purifiers that don't filter particles. You need to check on the box that it's physically rated to remove particles from the air,\" Dr Johnston said.\n\nIt's also a good idea to take advantage of periods of clean air to ventilate your home, as smoke can take some time to disperse unless the house is opened up.\n\nBut when air quality is low, staying inside is the most effective protection, Professor Vardoulakis said.\n\n\"I think the general message is we need to minimise exposure and there are different ways of doing that -- on days with high air pollution, it's better to spend more time indoors, less time outdoors, especially to people who are sensitive,\" he said.\n\n\"For people who have a pre-existing illness, follow your medical plan, have access to your medication, to your inhaler, and make sure you don't go out for a jog.\"\n\nThat advice also applies to healthy people: you should avoid exercising outside when you can see smoke in the air.",

It will depend very much on the timing of the sea breeze as to what the temperatures could get to.\"\n\nReprieve will come in the form of a cold front on Saturday which will see Perth's maximum drop into the high 20s.\n\n\"On Saturday there's a frontal system approaching from the south-west and that will really push cooler air in and we'll see a drop in temperatures,\" Mr Bennett said.\n\nPerth's blistering start to summer comes on the back of a very warm November, which saw the city notch up a mean maximum temperature 2.4C above average.\n\nIt also smashed its record for the hottest ever November day when it hit 40.4C on November 16.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon a bushfire forced residents to evacuate their homes in the town of Forrestdale in Perth's south-east.\n\nThe blaze triggered an emergency warning and burnt through 47 hectares of bushland.\n\nAbout 100 firefighters and air bombers spent several hours trying to keep the fire away from homes and a nearby primary school.\n\nAuthorities are investigating the cause of the fire, which is thought to be suspicious.\n\nForrestdale Primary School will be shut on Wednesday.",

        "body": "The muscles of those who worked out looked like those of 25-year-olds and showed less of the inflammation that is tied to health problems as we age.\n\nRegular exercise throughout adulthood may protect our muscles against age-related loss and damage later, according to an interesting new study of lifelong athletes and their thighs. The study finds that active older men's muscles resemble, at a cellular level, those of 25-year-olds and weather inflammatory damage much better than the muscles of sedentary older people.\n\nThe study also raises some cautionary questions about whether waiting until middle age or later to start exercising might prove to be challenging for the lifelong health of our muscles.\n\nPhysical aging is a complicated and enigmatic process, as any of us who are living and experiencing it know. Precipitated by little-understood changes in the workings of our cells and physiological systems, it proceeds in stuttering fits and starts, affecting some people and body parts earlier or more noticeably than others.\n\nMuscles are among the body parts most vulnerable to time. Almost all of us begin losing some muscle mass and strength by early middle age, with the process accelerating as the decades pass. While the full causes for this decline remain unknown, most aging researchers agree that a subtle, age-related rise in inflammation throughout our bodies plays a role.\n\n\"A lot of studies, probably thousands, show that higher circulating inflammatory factors in people are associated with greater loss of muscle mass,\" says Todd Trappe, a professor of exercise science at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., who oversaw the new study with his brother Scott Trappe and other researchers.\n\nDr. Trappe and his collaborators, who long have been studying the physiology of older athletes, also knew that physically fit people tend to have lower levels of inflammation in their bodies than inactive people. So, the researchers wondered, would active, older people also have more and healthier muscle mass than other older people? And if so, what might that tell us about how human muscles can optimally age?\n\nTo find out, the Ball State scientists turned to a unique group of volunteers. Local men and women in their 70s or 80s who had been training continuously since the running boom of the 1970s, these volunteers already were part of several interrelated studies at Ball State.\n\nNow, the researchers wanted to look deep inside the older athletes' blood and muscles. So, they gathered 21 of the elderly athletic men (results from a separate study of women will be published soon, Dr. Trappe says), along with 10 runners and cyclists in their 20s, and another 10 healthy but sedentary elderly men. They measured all of the men's thighs, as a marker of muscle mass, and took blood and muscle-tissue samples.\n\nThey noted immediately that the men's thigh circumference reflected their ages and lifestyles, with the young athletes sporting the burliest legs, the elderly athletes slightly smaller ones, and the inactive elderly men the spindliest.\n\nThe researchers next had the men complete a single session of brief, but strenuous, lower-body weight training, using a knee-extension machine. Since none of the men lifted weights, this exercise was expected to stress their muscles in an unfamiliar way. A few hours later, the researchers again drew blood and biopsied the men's muscles.\n\nThen they checked the tissues for a broad slate of inflammatory cells and gene markers. Bogglingly complex, inflammation involves multiple genes and cells that talk to other genes and cells and dynamically ramp up, or tamp down, the process. Immediately after any bodily injury or strain, which includes strenuous exercise, inflammation helps tissues to heal and strengthen. But if inflammation lingers, it can become harmful and, in muscles, block them from growing larger and stronger after exercise.\n\nThe researchers found that inflammatory responses differed in the men. The young athletes displayed the least amount of inflammation in their blood and muscles at the start of the study and continued to do so after the workout. While their muscles flared briefly after exercise with inflammatory cells and related gene activity, the microscopic examination found that countervailing anti-inflammatory signals were also increasing and should soon cool the inflammation.\n\nA similar response occurred inside the muscles of the elderly athletes, although their inflammatory markers were slightly higher and their anti-inflammatory reactions a bit lower.\n\nBut in the untrained elderly men, inflammation was much more of a bushfire, spiking higher than among the other men and showing fewer cellular signs of resolving any time soon.\n\nTaken as a whole, these results suggest that long-term exercise may help aging muscles remain healthy in part by readying them to dissipate inflammation, Dr. Trappe says. But on the flip side, sedentary living seems to set up muscles to overreact to strain and remain inflamed, potentially leading to fewer muscular gains when someone does exercise.\n\nThis study was small, though, and examined the men's muscles only once, soon after exercise. It did not look into whether and how their muscles actually changed over time with training.\n\nMore important, the findings should not discourage middle-aged or older people who have been inactive from starting to visit the gym, Dr. Trappe says. \"Even if inflammation gets in the way a bit at first, your muscles will respond and grow,\" he says, and eventually should start to resemble those of people who have been exercising lifelong.",

        "body": "Adam Scott, Sergio Garcia, Ernie Els and other players at this week's Australian Open could have another course hazard to contend with: smoke from nearby bushfires.\n\nA temperature inversion which formed over Sydney on Monday night trapped smoke in the region on Tuesday and caused considerable haze during a practice round. Golf Australia said it plans to increase on-site medical staff if the fire-driven smog disrupts the tournament.\n\nWith a wind shift on Wednesday, the situation had improved during the pro-am, but Golf Australia chief executive Stephen Pitt said he was concerned with the potential for smoke affecting the health of players.\n\n\"It was pretty bad yesterday, stinging eyes and all that,\" Scott said after his pro-am round on Wednesday.\n\nThere were about 25 bush and grass fires burning across New South Wales state, including a large one in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. A westerly wind on Tuesday moved a lot of the smoke from that fire over Sydney.\n\nWhile Pitt said he was confident the tournament would proceed without any smoke delays, he said officials will closely monitor the weather with children and elderly spectators most susceptible to the threatening air quality.\n\n\"Firstly our issues with smoke at a golf tournament pale into insignificance with the things that home owners and property owners and people right around the country have dealt with,\" Pitt said of the fires which have killed six people and destroyed dozens of homes.\n\n\"So we're very aware of that fact and all our sympathies and thoughts go to them because that's the real issue.\"\n\nPitt said it was a new type of threat for the tournament.\n\n\"It's something we've never had to give consideration to before,\" he said. \"We've had storms and rain and hail and heat and cold and all those sort of things that are your typical golf tournament issues. But this one is new and we have been in constant contact with the Bureau of Meteorology.\"\n\nScott is among the International players for next week's Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne playing this week in Sydney for team captain Els. Also in Sydney for the first time in his career is Louis Oosthuizen, the only South African player on the International team.\n\nOther International team players at The Australian Golf Club this week are Marc Leishman, Cameron Smith, defending champion Abraham Ancer and Taiwan's C.T. Pan.\n\nThe International team's only win over the United States team was in 1998 when it was first held at Royal Melbourne.\n\n\"I think we all sort of feel Royal Melbourne is the place we've got probably the best shot,\" Oosthuizen said. \"We've got a team that's really in form. We've got a young side coming through. I think having an Aussie crowd behind us, playing Royal Melbourne especially, I think it will be the best home course advantage we can have.\"",

        "body": "Sorry, we can't show this content as your browser does not support iframes.\n\nAn anchor has been cut from rugby in Australia following the conclusion of the Israel Folau saga, former Test star turned commentator Greg Martin says.\n\nRA and Folau issued a joint statement on Wednesday after reaching a confidential settlement, with both parties apologising for their actions.\n\nThe matter has been hanging over RA and the Wallabies for the past seven months since Folau was sacked from his $4m four-year contract for inflammatory social media posts and Martin was thrilled to see the end of it.\n\nMartin said Folau had been dragging rugby down through the Bledisloe Cup, Rugby Championship and last month's World Cup in Japan.\n\n\"We've had some good results with the under 20s, we've got a new (Wallabies) coach, but every time there's good news Izzy has stuck his head up and said, 'I want more money, I'm still suing, I haven't gone away', Martin told AAP.\n\n\"Well today is like Christmas because he's finally gone away.\n\n\"The anchor has been cut and we've finally cut him loose so that's the last we will hear of him and rugby.\"\n\nMartin said he wasn't concerned that RA had to apologise to Folau as part of the settlement but felt there were still questions over chief executive Raelene Castle's handling of the matter.\n\n\"That's lawyer stuff - they wanted that and to reach a settlement everyone had to give a bit of ground and Australian rugby union (RA) had to give a lot of money so that's the way it's gone,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be a bit of digging going on as to what happened with his contract that it wasn't water-tight so we couldn't sack him after he'd done it (posted) once.\"\n\nThe settlement doesn't appear to have opened the door for Folau to return to playing football, in any code.\n\nIn the joint statement there was no comment from RA about his playing future while Folau also didn't mention his next career move after stints in league, AFL and then rugby.\n\nA spokesman for Folau said that he wouldn't be making any immediate comment about his future, while RA said the 30-year-old wouldn't be playing rugby in Australia again under the current administration.\n\nFolau's most recent comments, linking the current bushfires to gay marriage, immediately put him offside with new Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V'landys.\n\nHis predecessor Peter Beattie had already said Folau would not be welcome in the NRL and V'landys backed that stance, saying he had zero tolerance for the ex-Storm and Broncos star's anti-gay messages.\n\nA future in French rugby is also unlikely with outspoken owner of rugby club Toulon, Mourad Boudjellal, labelling Folau a \"moron\".",

        "body": "From the point of view of resolving the many issues raised, however - and more particularly holding Folau to account for his damaging actions - it is singularly dissatisfying.\n\nAs one who has followed the issues closely since Folau first disgraced himself by putting up a post endorsing the view that gays are destined for hell, and who has written and ranted about it extensively, I am more aware than most of the damage he has done, the hurt he has caused. In the 21st century, his homophobic gibberish - you heard me - simply has no place. And it is no excuse that the gibberish in question is sourced from the Bible. I was hoping the court would confirm that, hence the dissatisfaction.\n\nIt was for that reason my first reaction on hearing the news - and I write in the first few minutes thereafter - was the settlement was, firstly, a great pity. Secondly, my stronger reaction was I hoped RA kept the presumed payment to him to an absolute minimum. Everybody wants to know how much. I have no inside knowledge of the terms, not even a hint, but my bet is it will be about $200,000 to $300,000. RA was confident its case was a slam-dunk legally. It had ample evidence he had made a legal commitment to not put up damaging posts again, and that this was a matter of a broken contract. RA never wavered in its view it had no choice but to sack him, and had evidence for that, too. Since being sacked, Folau has continued to lose support due to his ongoing outrages, such as linking the bushfires and drought to Australia's backing of same-sex marriage.\n\nSo with all that, why settle?\n\nBecause if it was a relatively small amount, a couple of hundred grand or the like, it would be worth it to finish the agony, stop the legal bills and allow RA to focus exclusively on the game again.",

        "body": "Local trainer Paul Smith credits the hard work of young Grady Spokes as a big reason for the good form of Lolly Dolly and a win at Coffs Harbour would be a well-deserved reward for the pair.\n\nSmith said Lolly Dolly was a bit of a handful when she arrived at his stables and while she still had her moments, he had seen a big improvement in her attitude thanks to Spokes.\n\n\"She hasn't been the easiest horse to handle but she has settled down quite a lot now,\" Smith said. \"Grady is Ray's son and he has done all the work on her this preparation, riding her trackwork, and has done a really great job with her.\n\nStream over 50 sports Live & On-Demand with KAYO SPORTS on your TV, computer, mobile or tablet.

She can pull pretty hard on the track but they get along very well together.\n\n\"I really hope she wins as much for Grady as the owners and myself.\"\n\nThe daughter of Warhead is knocking on the door for a win after placing at her past two starts and is one of the leading chances in the Showcase Maiden Plate over 1400m.\n\nAt just her second race start, Lolly Dolly was runner-up to Tierra Del Fuego at Lismore on November 11 before finishing third on the Gold Coast last Wednesday.\n\n\"She was super at the Gold Coast and to me it looks like the 1400m will suit her,\" Smith said. \"She's backing up from last Wednesday, which is something I don't normally do. But she has done well since she came back from the Coast. It looks a winnable race and I'm just hoping she has a little bit of luck go her way.\"\n\nResumed for new stable with a solid second at the Gold Coast on November 16. Will take improvement out of the run and looks tough to beat.\n\nGiven no peace in front when a brave second at Lismore two starts back before a nice third at the Gold Coast last start. Improving mare who can break through for her first win today.Words\n\nHandy effort for fourth at Muswellbrook first-up before a seventh at Kensington in much stronger company. Will appreciate the drop back in grade.\n\nTop local hoop RAYMOND SPOKES has a strong book of seven rides, including Lolly Dolly and Moonhawk for Paul Smith and Brother Magic for Brett Bellamy.\n\nSmith's confidence in stablemate Delayed Response was dampened when the mare drew barrier 18 in the Class 1 Handicap over 1300m.\n\n\"She's going really well and I couldn't be happier with her,'' he said. \"Unfortunately, she has drawn the outside gate first-up because I would have given her a very good chance if she had drawn a middle gate. We'll just have to ride her for luck.\"\n\nSmith has a good opinion of the four-year-old mare and has his sights set on the Country Championships.\n\n\"I'm hoping she can develop into a Country Championships contender,'' he said.\n\n\"She did well last preparation and while she would need to improve, being by So You Think I think she will continue to develop with maturity.\"\n\nSmith's final runner for the day is in the last race with Moonhawk, who could book himself a trip to Sydney for a TAB Highway with another strong performance. The Moonlark three-year-old resumed from a spell with an impressive win at Grafton on October 21.\n\n\"He's a very nice horse who does go quite well,\" Smith said.\n\n\"He won first-up over 1100m and while he's back to 1000m, he is six weeks between runs, so dropping back in distance won't be a problem. He's a very genuine racehorse and I think he will be more than competitive in a Highway.\"\n\nMeantime, John Sprague was more than pleased with the effort of Spirit In The Sky on his debut for the stable and feels he is a genuine contender at Coffs Harbour.\n\nThe son of Spirit Of Boom stepped out at Port Macquarie last Tuesday and the former Victorian was gallant in defeat when runner-up to Brookwyn over 1200m.\n\n\"It was a very good effort,\" Sprague said. \"He just ran into one of Kim Waugh's who was better on the day. He hadn't had a run for six weeks and we didn't know exactly where we were with him, being new to the stable, but we weren't disappointed.\"\n\nThe three-year-old had placed in three of his five starts in Victoria before failing at Cranbourne at his final start there in October.\n\n\"We had him ready to go a little while ago but missed out on a few race meetings due to all the bushfires,\" Sprague said.\n\n\"We are backing up a little bit quick but being a Showcase day, you have to take those challenges. Ideally, I would have liked to have given him a little bit longer between runs but that's just the way it is.\"\n\nSprague is quietly confident The Kroc can bounce back from his last-start eighth at Gosford despite his big weight in the Benchmark 58 over 1600m. The five-year-old was a winner at Kempsey two starts back over Condover Hall, who looks one of the main hopes on Thursday.\n\n\"He's got the 62kg but he's 17.2 hands so I don't think the weight is going to slow him down too much,\" Sprague said. \"He won well at Kempsey and I'm going into the race fairly confident he will be right there again.\"\n\nMaid Marilyn is Sprague's final runner for the day but she has been a source of frustration.\n\n\"She's a bit of a mystery bag,\" he said. \"We just can't work her out. She seems to working very well but just not doing it in her races. I've put blinkers and a tongue-tie on her and we'll see if that works. There is definitely a bit of ability there, we just have to get it out of her.\"\n\nDebutant Vecchietta is a nicely-bred filly by Deep Field from the handy Vecchia Roma, who was stakes placed. This filly has a win and a second in her two trials and, while the times haven't been quick, she hasn't been placed under any real pressure. Shy Boy has placed at each of his four starts this campaign, the latest a third at the Gold Coast on November 23. Money Travels resumes from a spell and has placed at each of his three previous first-up runs.\n\nBeachbreak is a grandson of Group 1 Oakleigh Plate winner Miss Kournikova. He stepped out for new trainers Toby and Trent Edmonds and turned in an encouraging effort when a length second at the Gold Coast after racing greenly. Can go one better. Hard Lady came from well back to finish second to Illecebrous over 1100m at Scone when resuming on November 21. Spirit In The Sky was solid when second to Brookwyn at Port Macquarie last start and will be improved by the run.\n\nLolly Dolly continues to improve with each run and can break through for her maiden win here. Was taken on in front and fought on bravely when second at Lismore two starts back before a good third at the Gold Coast last week. Dawn Thunder hasn't been far away of late and is close to win. Arlington Valley was held up on straightening when fourth at Ballina first-up from a long spell.\n\nMill City got a long way back and ran on strongly for fourth to St Luke when resuming at Muswellbrook on October 22. Stepped up sharply in class to a Bm70 at Kensington when seventh to Palurien. Will appreciate this easier assignment. Lose The Snip led and tried hard when fourth to Trophies Galore in the TAB Highway at Newcastle on November 16. Placed at all three runs this track. Radiant Choice was a handy third at Grafton last start and can't be taken lightly.\n\nControlthewitness settled back in the field and stuck to the fence when third to Dukes County at Scone on November 21. Will get back again from wide draw but sure to be in the finish. Luga Lad was having his first start for new trainer Nathan Doyle when third at Quirindi on November 24. Drawn well and won't be far away again. Condover Hall is a last-start winner over 2000m at Port Macquarie and drops back to the mile here.\n\nLightly-raced five-year-old Brother Magic is a promising type who hasn't missed a place in his five starts. Held on to score a narrow win at Ballina on November 25 and is a big chance again. Gold Coast visitor Invincore has won two of his four starts and is the hardest to beat. Overraced in front but toughed it out to score at Grafton last start. Eyebea Dancer tried hard when second to Mr Grumpy at Port Macquarie last week.\n\nTerzo Millennio was given plenty of experience at the trials before making his race debut at Doomben in October. Has improved with each run and looked good winning at Ballina last start. Painted Wolf tried hard when third at Murwillumbah on October 15 before an unlucky third at Grafton last start after being held up in the run. Beat That won at Lismore two starts back before a third to Invincore last time out.\n\nKeen Power kicked off his career in the best possible way with a two-length win over Miss Whittington after racing wide all-the-way. Will prove hard to beat again. Hiroko got a little squeeze close to the line when a narrow third to Chazelles when resuming at Ballina on November 15. Will be right in the finish again. Moonhawk is a handy type who must be kept safe. Resumed with a nice win at Grafton on October 21.",

        "body": "As Australia's bushfires rage, smoke is posing a growing health risk.\n\nBushfire smoke carries PM2.5 particles - which have a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less - and can cause long-term health problems.\n\nPeople with asthma, lung disease or cardiovascular disease, and the young and the elderly, are all at particular risk, and New South Wales Health advises them to stay indoors and limit exposure on smoky days.\n\nIncreasingly, people are turning to face masks. But are they any practical use?\n\nDr Christine Cowie, a respiratory health expert from the Centre for Air Pollution, Energy and Health Research and the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, spoke to Guardian Australia.\n\nWill a mask do anything?\n\nIn most cases, the answer is no.\n\nThere are very few academic studies about the effectiveness of face masks, and wearing a mask is not the main recommended safety measure.\n\nCrucially, a surgeon's mask (or similar cloth or paper masks) won't work - the particles in bushfire smoke are too fine.\n\nCowie says the only effective mask is a P2 mask - the kind worn by builders and sold in hardware stores.\n\nAnd, it has to seal well around your face. Which means you need to test it out for fit, like shoes or clothes. Different face and nose shapes will need different masks.\n\n\"If it is not fitted very carefully over the nose and mouth, people will still be exposed to the smoke,\" she says. \"And you need to inspect the package and make sure it will filter out PM2.5.\"\n\nCowie says a mask is \"not the best public health measure that we can offer\".\n\n\"We support the advice from the health department, which is to stay indoors and trying to minimise your exposure as much as possible.\"\n\nFor those at particular risk, \"adhering to your medication program is the main messages we want to get out\".\n\nWill an air purifier or air conditioner help?\n\nCowie says the research is still \"not sure\" about air conditioners. General household air conditioners do not have the filters needed for PM2.5.\n\nIf one is used, it must be put on a recirculation setting so it is not taking in air from outside.\n\nAir purifiers - with a specific Hepa filter - could do more.\n\n\"There are a few studies that indicate air purifiers are useful in reducing particulate matter indoors, but they do need to be fitted with a Hepa filter,\" Cowie says.\n\nBe aware that every purifier has a set amount of area it can purify.\n\n\"One small air purifier will not do a whole house,\" Cowie says.\n\nIf vulnerable, see a doctor\n\nAbove all, if in doubt, or if you are particularly vulnerable, see a doctor.\n\nThis includes anyone with asthma, a cardiovascular or respiratory condition, or vulnerable people such as young children and the elderly.\n\nCowie stresses that asthma attacks can be fatal.\n\nThose with asthma medication should have a preventer puffer (separate to a reliever puffer) and should use it every day.\n\nThose concerned about overusing their medicine should speak to their doctor and double-check their regime.\n\nShe also advises that residents should try to check the most specific air quality index they can.\n\nThe NSW Environmental Protection Agency and NSW Health put out health alerts, and people can subscribe to specific area air quality alerts.\n\nAgain, pay specific attention to the PM2.5 reading - and be aware that it can vary widely between regions.",

        "body": "Related Story: Energy operator moves to prevent blackouts in Victoria and SA heatwave\n\nExtreme weather forecast for summer will reduce the reliability of power supply across Australia in the coming months, with ageing coal plants becoming less reliable, the energy market operator has warned.\n\nIn August, Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said a worst-case scenario could see up to 1.3 million Victorian households without power on extreme weather days if supply was not improved and major generators were not repaired.\n\nThat risk remains.\n\nBut the operator said a boom in rooftop and grid-scale solar generation in the past year had created the bulk of an extra 3,700 megawatts of generation in the national energy market.\n\nThe AEMO summer-readiness plan showed that Victoria remained the state at the highest risk of power outages due to faults at a coal plant in the Latrobe Valley and a gas plant in the west of the state.\n\nThe operator also warned that increased dust storms from the drought in New South Wales and Queensland was a risk to solar panels.\n\nIn Victoria's east, a coal unit at Loy Yang in Gippsland is still not fixed, but AGL said it would be back online by mid-December.\n\nMeanwhile, a gas plant in the west of the state is not due to be operational until the end of the year.\n\nIn an effort to reduce risk, AEMO and Victoria have secured 125 megawatts of extra reserves.\n\nAs part of this backup power plan, big energy users, including recycling company Visy, agree to reduce usage on extreme temperature days.\n\nOther states also run the risk of unplanned blackouts because of the increased heatwaves and bushfires.\n\n\"In any region, the actual occurrence of load shedding [planned power outage] could be higher than forecast ... given particular combinations of weather events, plant outages, or bushfires,'' the report said.\n\nWhen supplies are stretched, AEMO may direct power networks to cut power to customers, which is called load shedding.\n\nNetworks may also have to shut down areas if the infrastructure cannot handle the demand from homes and businesses.\n\nThe industry said it was working hard to meet demand.\n\n\"Losing power, even for short periods during a heatwave, can cause real inconvenience,\" Australian Energy Council chief executive Sarah McNamara said.\n\n\"But electricity providers will continue to do everything possible to avoid that occurring.\n\n\"We are working with AEMO to have sufficient supply available for the hotter periods.\"\n\nThe spread of rooftop solar, the report said, had boosted capacity and meant that the peak for demand on hot days was occurring later in the day once the sun sets.\n\nDrought could also limit the effectiveness of hydro-electricity generation.\n\nThe summer-readiness plan has also highlighted how ageing coal plants continue to be less reliable especially during extreme weather and drier conditions.\n\n\"These risks add to the deteriorating reliability of some of the older coal generation plants,\" AEMO's chief executive officer Audrey Zibelman said.\n\n\"Whilst unexpected events can and do happen, particularly when the power system is under significant pressure and most prone to failure, AEMO has worked diligently to prepare the power system appropriately, including the procurement of emergency resources.\"\n\nImprovements to transmission also remain key, with the current network restricting the distribution of some new energy generation.\n\nThe market operator has also secured secondary backup supplies through short and medium term agreements with business to power down -- but they are only paid if they do reduce use.",

        "body": "It encapsulated the horror engulfing New South Wales: the footage of a koala mewing in pain as its habitat burned around it. The rescue of that animal, saved from the Long Flat blaze by a woman using her shirt as a shield, went viral.\n\nBut the bushfires have injured and displaced vast numbers of other creatures, many of which no longer have homes. Who rescues them - and what does that involve?\n\nKristie Newton works as campaign manager for the NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service (Wires), an organisation that, in normal times, says it cares for tens of thousands of hurt or distressed animals each year.\n\nBut these are not normal times.\n\n\"We are completely inundated at the moment,\" she says. \"This is the biggest event we have ever dealt with.\"\n\nAustralia's flora and fauna have evolved to coexist with fire - but not with fires of such intensity. Wires' search and rescue teams still can't access many affected areas, even as people in towns or outer suburbs report injured animals fleeing into backyards or roads.\n\n\"We probably won't know what we're looking at for about a month or so, maybe longer, until we can really go in and start to get more animals out. But we've lost a lot of habitat, so it's not only directly affecting the animals now, but will continue to affect them for years to come.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment echoed by Vickii Lett, a veteran carer with Clarence Valley Wires.\n\nShe's dedicated her property in Lightning Creek near Grafton to caring for wild creatures, so much so that she takes an instant to recall just how many she's currently sheltering.\n\n\"I've got three flying foxes, one koala, three - no, four! - redneck wallabies (one of which is burned), and one wallaroo. Oh, and a boobook owl.\"\n\nA volunteer since 1988, Lett has never experienced fires of such ferocity, affecting such a vast area.\n\n\"This is man-made; we've done it,\" she says.\n\nAt the same time, she worries that the immediate crisis might cloak the broader wildlife emergency, the everyday devastation of deforestation and land clearing.\n\n\"When you're a wildlife carer, fairly early you realise that you might be able to fix animals, but you've got to have somewhere to put them. They're not pets, but when I release them, I worry about every one of them. They've got to have a home and a food supply.\"\n\nWires offers a short rescue and immediate care course that equips people to work with common species.\n\nVolunteers can nominate their level of commitment. They can decide to be carers or rescuers or both - or help with various administrative tasks.\n\nSome take on additional training to specialise in particular animals - anything from koalas to venomous snakes.\n\nThat's how Kristina-Lee Willis, a 29-year-old from Corindi Beach (two hours north of Port Macquarie), ended up with Teddy, the baby sugar glider.\n\nOriginally, Willis wanted to rescue bats - \"to break down the knee-jerk reaction that 'ewww they're disgusting',\" - but the first course available focused on possums and gliders.\n\nThen, during the recent blaze, a crew clearing firebreaks on an isolated road near Glenreagh found a glider joey on the ground.\n\n\"It was so sweet: this big burly bloke who was driving the dozer carried her crooked up in his arm all the way back to their base. A lady made the call to Wires and then another two gentlemen drove her to the Golden Dog pub in the middle of Glenreagh. And I took her from there.\"\n\nA little glider means a lot of work.\n\nTeddy - named after the dozer driver who cuddled her - only drinks a special milk formula.\n\n\"She's very clever,\" says Willis, with maternal pride. \"She doesn't need a bottle. She laps at milk from the tiny little spoon or from the bottle cap.\"\n\nBut that's just the beginning.\n\n\"Now she's older, she's getting little bugs like crickets and meal worms and some moths when I can catch them, though that's really tricky. And also some sap. She likes to chew on some branches and lick at blossoms as well.\"\n\nTeddy's gaining weight and will, with luck, make a full recovery.\n\nBut she's just one animal - and so very, very many need help. At the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, the volunteers feel that strain.\n\nThe facility boasts 14 intensive care units and can house up to 50 animals.\n\nHospital president Sue Ashton worked in the corporate world before retiring to Port Macquarie two years ago, and then taking up a vacancy on the hospital board. \"I enjoyed my old job. But this is so satisfying - working with wild animals and seeing them rehabilitated back into the wild.\"\n\nYet after the recent fires, she fears for the long-term future of the species.\n\nIn places like the Lake Innes nature reserve, as many as two-thirds of wild koalas seem to have died, incinerated by the astonishing heat. Those that survived were dehydrated; many had been burned on their paws, noses and mouths.\n\n\"We've got to cut the dead skin off, bathe their wounds, then treat them with a cream for burns and bandage them,\" Ashton says. \"We're giving them a low lactose milk supplement, for extra nutrients and hydration - some of them aren't eating leaves because their mouth is burnt. The really bad ones have gone into home care. Some might need to be fed more frequently; they need to have their noses rubbed with cream or something like that.\"\n\nMany of the centre's 150 volunteers currently come in almost daily, and their physical exhaustion exacerbates the toll of watching animals suffer.\n\nBurns are, after all, notoriously difficult to heal. Several of the injured koalas, including the one rescued at Long Flat, have had to be euthanised.\n\nNicole Blums, from Brisbane's Rescue Collective, knows how shattering wildlife volunteering can be.\n\nShe established her group specifically to help resource frontline carers, providing them with basic materials as well as little gifts to lift their spirits.\n\n\"Over the last nine days,\" she says, \"Wires has received nine carloads and trailer loads of resources from us. That includes medical supplies, drugs for the animals, formulas, feeding bottles, joey pouches, bat wraps: anything that they need to be able to spend more time with the animals.\"\n\nA fortnight ago, her group consisted of four women; now it's grown to about 20.\n\nLike the other volunteers, she's been appalled by the fires; like them, she's been buoyed by the community response.\n\n\"Working in rescue, you see a lot of bad things and you can begin to hate the human race,\" Blums says. \"But every time we start to think it's too much, it's too heavy for our hearts, we open a box and we find a letter from one of our supporters or a drawing from one of the kids.\" Her voice catches slightly. \"That gives us strength to know that we are making a difference and that we have so much behind us now that we can't stop.\"\n\nThe rescue organisations need donations. They also need volunteers. But Wires' Kristie Newton stresses that it's possible for anyone to help native animals, just by taking very simple steps.\n\n\"If people are in an area that's affected by fire or even by heat, if they can leave bowls of water for birds and animals, that's fantastic.\"\n\nLikewise, a cardboard box and towel kept in your car can help contain an injured animal, if it's possible to do so safely.\n\n\"If you do encounter any injured animals,\" she says, \"call your local wildlife group - and get them help as soon as possible. It really can save lives.\"",

        "body": "A fatal car crash sparked a bushfire in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia, on Wednesday, December 3, local media reported. The fire was burning more than 200 hectares (about 500 acres) near Pelaw Main in the Hunter region at the time of writing, according to an update from the NSW Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS). The fire was initially under the highest emergency warning and then downgraded to the mid-range Watch and Act level. The blaze was most recently downgraded to the lowest warning level due to cooler temperatures and decreasing wind speeds, the NSW RFS said. The fire was moving in a southeastern direction toward Richmond Vale, and firefighters were working to protect nearby homes, according to the NSW RFS. Homes on Richmond Vale Road were evacuated, while some other residents were urged to seek shelter as it was \"too late\" for them to leave, local media reported. This video shows a large air tanker dropping fire retardant on the blaze as smoke fills the sky. The NSW RFS said there were currently 111 fires burning in the region, 51 of which were not yet contained. The Pelaw Main fire started when a vehicle drove off the road, hit a pole, and ignited, reports said. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. Credit: NSW Rural Fire Service via Storyful",

On Sunday, officials announced they found 52-year-old Tamra McBeath-Riley near a waterhole where the group had been staying.\n\nMcBeath-Riley said during a Monday news conference that on Thursday her friends -- Claire Hockridge, 46, and Tran -- began the 12-mile journey to reach a nearby highway, planning to avoid the desert heat -- which came close to 104 Fahrenheit in recent days -- by walking at night and carrying whatever water they could find.\n\n\"We tried many times to try to get out, but just couldn't get out, so ventured forth to try and find some shelter and some water,\" she said. \"The river was just too large, we couldn't get out.\"\n\nDuring the day, the group dug a hole underneath the car to stay cool and then slept in the vehicle at night, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. During that time period, the trio survived on six liters of water, 10 cans of iced vodka, a packet of biscuits and some beef noodles.\n\nMcBeath-Riley said she decided to stay at the waterhole with her Staffordshire terrier because she did not think the dog would survive a walk to the Stuart Highway, which connects Australia's north and south coasts. The group did not know if anyone was looking for them.\n\nAUSTRALIAN FIREFIGHTER ACCUSED OF ARSON AMID BUSHFIRE CRISIS, POLICE SAY\n\nVicary told Australia's NT News that Tran and Hockridge separated after finding the fence on the farm property, and the 40-year-old decided to follow the fence line for two days until he was discovered by the farmer and given water.\n\nShe added that Tran was \"slightly disoriented\" when he was found but in good spirits.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPolice said Monday that rescue efforts have \"ramped up,\" with two helicopters covering 14 square miles from the Stuart Highway, the general area where it is believed Hockridge may be. Vicary said that so far searchers had only found one set of footprints.\n\n\"It's quite a diverse terrain,\" she told reporters. \"There's sandy dunes, there's hard clay, there's areas of dense trees, but there are also rocks and ranges in the area.\"",

        "body": "Also, any credible assessment of his legacy will require the final publication of Promontory's review of accountability for the AUSTRAC mess as well as the outcome of reviews and investigations by the prudential and securities regulators.\n\nIt is almost certain other executives will have to share responsibility for the failure in the bank's controls, operational procedures and reporting system for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.\n\nNevertheless, it is possible, even at this time of heightened emotional responses to the AUSTRAC disaster, to compile a scorecard of how Hartzer performed against the financial and operational measures.\n\nHartzer's tenure as CEO began on February 2, 2015. He inherited deep-seated technology problems from Gail Kelly. She inherited the same from David Morgan. Lack of investment in systems over 20 years left the bank vulnerable to technology disruption and poorly prepared to respond to changing consumer behaviour.\n\nThe acquisition of St George Bank brought into the Westpac fold a superior banking platform but neither Kelly or Hartzer were able to make the financial commitment to put the entire bank on one platform.\n\nHartzer spent a lot of time putting out bushfires that were left smouldering by his predecessors.\n\nHartzer spent years stabilising Westpac's systems which were notorious for outages. He only really fixed this in 2018. His tangible achievement in IT is the creation of the customer service hub which puts all of each customer's product relationships in one place.\n\nHe deserves praise for the appointment of two world leading chief information officers: Dave Curran and Craig Bright. But he leaves behind a spaghetti of legacy systems that must be fixed at some stage to bring Westpac up to scratch with the industry leader, Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nThe shining IT legacy of Hartzer's tenure was the Panorama wealth platform. It gives Westpac a strong position in retirement incomes but it cost twice what was expected and took several years longer than expected to be fully operational.\n\nHartzer preserved Westpac's iron-clad commitment to credit quality. This cultural trait was seared into the bank's soul in the \"near death\" experience in 1991-92. But having industry leading credit quality is not much good if your loan book is flat or going backwards.\n\nExecutive changes Hartzer made in consumer banking and business banking failed to deliver industry leading results. Progress in Hartzer's goal of a \"customer revolution\" was extremely slow. The bank's net promoter score in consumer retail was negative when the world's best banks have NPS scores of 50 or higher.\n\nHartzer spent a lot of time putting out bushfires that were left smouldering by his predecessors. The bank's wealth management division was built on the crooked foundations of commission driven sales.\n\nBy the time Hartzer came to fix this problem it was a key focus of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Hayne royal commission. The bank severely underestimated the cost of remediation which ballooned to about 10 times the original estimate.\n\nHartzer performed well in front of Kenneth Hayne and always put in a consummate performance in front of the parliamentary committees. Mind you, the woeful talent of some of the MPs helped make Hartzer look especially good at times.\n\nHis tenure coincided with a crackdown on capital by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. He had to oversee two capital raisings to ensure Westpac was unquestionably strong. Unfortunately for shareholders the AUSTRAC matter could stretch the bank's capital.\n\nHartzer and the outgoing chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, get poor marks for succession planning. The bench strength on the executive committee is weak relative to other banks and it is not immediately obvious that the successor for Maxsted is already in the boardroom.\n\nFor many Westpac investors, the ultimate measure of performance is the total shareholder return. Over Hartzer's time as CEO the stock returned 8.7 per cent compared to 59 per cent for the S&P ASX200.\n\nThe three other big banks beat Westpac's performance by a wide margin, with the exception of ANZ Banking Group which was up 12 per cent. CBA was up 31 per cent and National Australia Bank up 20 per cent.",

Whether it's putting up Christmas lights or food on the tables of vulnerable people in your community, every bit of goodwill counts this festive season.\n\nVolunteers at FareShare kitchen at Morningside are rolling up their sleeves to help fill the bellies of some of southeast Queensland's most vulnerable this Christmas.\n\n\"FareShare volunteers are making a special Christmas edition lunch for Dig In, one of our charity partners,\" FareShare's Mary Pope said.\n\n\"Dig In serves a free FareShare meal each Saturday at Kemp Place in Fortitude Valley for people in need, and we're pleased to be able to make them a full Christmas delight -- Roast turkey with all the trimmings, roast veg, gravy, baked ham and Xmas pudding with custard. Special Christmas cookies will also be available for guests to take away with them.\n\n\"Many of the meals made in our kitchen over the course of December will include Christmas flavours, and these too will be distributed across Queensland to communities in need this season.\"\n\nFareShare is always looking for volunteers over the age of 16 to help them create nourishing meals from Foodbank Queensland. Visit fareshare.net.au\n\nGIVIT is an online platform aiming to match donations from the public directly to those in need through charities and not-for-profits.\n\nThis festive season they are collecting gifts for children living in foster care, aiming for 9500 donated gifts for children from newborn through to 17 years old.\n\nThey are also collecting supplies for more than 150 people who lost their homes in bushfires across Australia this year, through financial donations from the general public. Visit givit.org.au\n\nMore than 137,000 animals are stuck in RSPCA shelters across the state this festive season. You could adopt a cat, dog, Guinea pig, or even chicken and change their life.\n\nBut if you don't have room for a pet then you can always donate animal food, beds, toys, bowls, brushes, nail clips, or jackets.\n\nHowever, if you prefer to donate time over money, you can volunteer your time and help to take care of the animals at one of their shelters. Visit rspca.qld.org.au\n\nAnother way to share the Christmas spirit is through volunteering for community projects. This is a good way to socialise with others as well as creating a place, performances, or product that benefits other people. Check out volunteeringqld.org.au to find an opportunity to contribute to your local community.\n\nWhile southeast Queensland is dry, much of Queensland is in the grips of drought. The final way you can share Christmas is by helping farming families, either through simple donations to charities like Rural Aid, Drought Angles, or Aussie Helpers. Donations can be financial, food (for farmers or animals), or water. Visit ruralaid.org.au or droughtangels.org.au or aussiehelpers.org.au\n\nSo, instead of staying home all Christmas holidays, come down to your local charities (Vinnies, R.S. P. C. A, Fare Share, or Drought Angles) and donate your time, money, clothes, etc. Or build a community garden, even just talk to the less fortunate, and share the Christmas Spirit.",

It is too late for them to leave.\n\nThe bushfire, which has burnt almost 30,000 hectares, has closed the Princes Highway between Batemans Bay and Dolphin Point.\n\nThe NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) urges people who remain in the cut-off areas west of the highway, between East Lynne and Termeil, as well as those between Bawley Point and North Durras, to monitor conditions, take the advice of firefighters, and follow their bushfire survival plans.\n\nResidents in South Durras are urged to leave towards Batemans Bay, while residents north of Termeil should head towards Ulladulla, if it's safe to do so.\n\nThe fire had been downgraded overnight from emergency to watch and act, but strengthening winds throughout the date increased the threat to coastal communities.\n\nThe fire continues to burn in an easterly and north-easterly direction towards Termeil.\n\nBen Shepherd, from the RFS, said the blaze grew significantly in the past few hours and more properties could be threatened this afternoon.\n\n\"We are expecting those conditions to hold through the afternoon as we continue to see these fires flare and run in some very dry landscape,\" he said.\n\n\"So there is the possibility we could see further homes come under threat, even around East Lynne, during the course of the afternoon.\"\n\nBawley Point's RFS captain, Charlie Magnuson, said earlier the weather would complicate efforts to save properties.\n\n\"We've got these westerlies coming, which are going to push the fire back towards the village, but at this stage we've done a fair bit of containment,\" he said.\n\n\"It's going to be a wait and see how much of that fire will impact either Kioloa or the Bawley Point village.\n\n\"There's a lot of potential for this to still come in on us.\"\n\nMore than 100 fires continue to burn across the state, dozens of which are uncontained.\n\nNSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said the threat was likely to worsen rather than ease.\n\n\"Unfortunately that's just going to continue to deteriorate as we head into the tail end of this week,\" he said.\n\n\"We are expecting to see much more widespread very high and severe [alerts] right across parts of NSW, including the South Coast, particularly as we head into Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"Given the winds and given how dry the landscape is and how volatile the fire behaviour is, any one of these fires could change their alert level.\"\n\nThe Currowan fire destroyed several buildings on Monday, including a house on the Clyde River and several \"other structures\", the RFS confirmed.\n\nHowever, no further details were available as firefighters were busy battling the blaze.",

Give your daily walk or exercise a miss and make it up when the smoke has gone.\"\n\nWhile people prone to respiratory conditions are advised to wear masks outdoors, he says people with a history of heart disease may consider doing the same.\n\nAlthough past studies have produced inconsistent findings, Professor Jennings says there is now an emerging consensus about the increased risk of heart failure, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary embolism and high blood pressure, during and in a few days after exposure to bushfire smoke.\n\nThe evidence shows the denser the smoke, the higher the risk.\n\nProfessor Jennings, a cardiologist, says the problem arises from fine particles in the smoke which are smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, a fraction the width of human hair.\n\nThese particles have the capacity to travel deep into the lung, into its smallest branches, where they can cross over into the bloodstream.\n\n\"Loaded with active ingredients, they can incite inflammation and other problems,\" says Professor Jennings.\n\n\"There is also a suggestion they make the blood a little more coagulable, which may explain the raised risk of stroke and pulmonary embolism.\"\n\nOthers suggest these particles can also affect the autonomic nervous system, which in turn may contribute to instability in blood pressure or increase the heart rate.\n\nLast year, a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, looked at over a million emergency room visits across California during 2015 wildfires.\n\nIt found a 10 per cent increased risk of presentation with heart attacks, strokes, worsened heart failure symptoms and irregular heart rhythms.\n\nOn dense smoke days, emergency department visits for these ailments jumped, particularly among elderly patients.\n\nThe study looked at other diseases too, such as appendicitis, and found no increase in hospital presentation.\n\nProfessor Jennings says the smoke can accelerate pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. \"Nobody gets a heart attack from the last five days. They've set themselves up to have it and the smoke might just bring it forward.\"\n\nTo date, evidence on the cardiovascular impact of bushfire smoke is only available for the short term.\n\nIn the meantime, he says having a heart check is better insurance than wearing a mask or staying inside.",

That changed after lightning strikes sparked fires in those areas.\n\n\"To be really blunt, it's an absolute crisis,\" Graham said.\n\n\"Because they've been permanently wet and have never burnt right through, they're like mountaintop arcs of ancient biodiversity.\n\n\"These fires have directly impacted upon the values they were listed for.\"\n\nFurther south, the Gospers Mountain fire has been burning out of control since last month in the Wollemi and Yengo national parks, part of the Greater Blue Mountains world heritage area, which covers one million hectares of national park and is dominated by temperate eucalypt forest.\n\nThe executive officer of the National Parks Association of NSW, Gary Dunnett, said the national parks of the Blue Mountains were some of the most fire-prone landscape in the country, particularly during drought.\n\n\"They're particularly vulnerable to these large-scale fires,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's reasonable to say we haven't seen anything on this scale since 2000-2001 and, again, the millennium drought was the big driver for that.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning, 118 fires were burning in NSW, 48 of them out of control.\n\nA spokeswoman for the NSW planning, industry and environment department said \"at 800,000 hectares burnt to date, this is much larger than the average season\".\n\n\"It's the largest season since 2002-03 which affected over one million hectares of parks and reserves,\" she said.\n\n\"The environmental conditions, combined with strong winds and extremely low humidity, makes firefighting extremely difficult and dangerous,\" she said.\n\n\"Many have referred to the NSW situation this year as unprecedented, and our experience to date would support this statement.\"\n\nShe said the Blue Mountains area was a landscape adapted to recover after fire, and more detailed assessments of the impact would occur when conditions were safer.\n\nSimilarly, post-fire mapping would be done in the Gondwana area to determine the full impact on the world heritage area because in some reserves it is only sections of national park that are world heritage listed.",

        "body": "Related Story: 'Hazardous' Sydney smoke to linger for days, authorities warn\n\nWaking up to a city full of smoke. It's the new norm in Sydney.\n\nThe spate of bushfires burning across NSW has given people in the Harbour City a taste of what it's like to live in a smog-choked megacity.\n\nNSW Department of Environment data shows Sydney's air quality this bushfire season is already three times worse than at any moment in the past five years.\n\nThis graph shows the amount of harmful pollutants in Greater Sydney's air since the start of this season's bushfire crisis compared to previous years.\n\nThe Department uses an Air Quality Index (AQI) to inform the public about pollution.\n\nThe AQI is calculated by measuring the amount of \"particulate matter\", or microscopic pollutants, in the atmosphere.\n\nWhile NSW Government measures several different categories of \"particulate matter\", the one of most concern to people's health is PM2.5.\n\nIt's also the smallest size the NSW Government measures -- about 3 per cent of the diameter of a human hair.\n\nThat means it can enter a person's lungs and bloodstream, and can trigger heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and asthma attacks.\n\nIn the past five years, albeit when there were fewer monitoring sites, there were only five recorded instances of a daily maximum AQI above 100, indicating \"poor\" air quality in Greater Sydney.\n\nIn November and December this year, there have already been about 80 -- over a quarter of these readings were above 200, which indicates \"hazardous\" air quality.\n\nIn health terms, the toxicity of the air in some parts of Sydney has gone from smoking half a cigarette, to between four and 10 per day.\n\nDirector of Environmental Health at NSW Health, Dr Richard Broome, said there had been an increase in the number of people presenting to emergency departments with respiratory issues.\n\nDuring the week ending November 22, there were around 2,230 ambulance calls for breathing problems -- a 22.5 per cent increase from Sydney's weekly average.\n\nIn the Mid-North Coast, where bushfires were so intense they created their own weather systems, the number of ambulance calls for breathing problems doubled over the same period.\n\nChristine Cowie, a senior fellow at the Centre for Air Pollution, Energy and Health Research at the University of NSW said breathing in the high amount of fine particles could affect physical development.\n\n\"Certainly people who are repeatedly exposed to high levels [of air pollutants] and if they're children for instance or elderly, it's likely to impact on their lung function,\" Dr Cowie said.\n\n\"It can affect lung growth ... kids' lungs will not grow to their full capacity and that may impact on them later in life.\"\n\nDr Cowie said there had been limited research into \"medium-term exposure\" to low air quality -- when a city is blanketed in smoke for weeks like Sydney.\n\n\"No one can say definitively what happens after a two-month exposure to those high levels, other than if you're susceptible, you're likely to have increased respiratory problems,\" she said.",

        "body": "Nearly 1800 firefighters and crew have worked through the night to slow the spread of rapidly moving bushfires across NSW as conditions are set to worsen today.\n\nA new bushfire was sparked this morning following a fatal car crash in the state's Hunter Region.\n\nEmergency services were called to Leggetts Drive, south of Pelaw Main, following reports a vehicle had left the road and collided with a pole.\n\nThe driver was found dead at the scene and is set to be formally identified.\n\nA crime scene has been established.\n\nAs a result of the crash, the vehicle caught alight and has sparked several spot fires around the area.\n\nLeggetts Drive is currently closed in both directions between Neath Street and Lake Road.\n\nAll vehicles are advised to use the M1 Motorway or the Hunter Expressway.\n\nDrivers are urged to avoid the area as firefighters work to extinguish the blazes.\n\nLingering smoke from bushfires to Sydney's north, south and west will again create poor air quality in parts of the city today.\n\nAir quality reached hazardous levels in parts of southwestern Sydney on Monday evening and was recorded as poor in parts of the city's east.\n\nThe state government says air quality on Tuesday will be \"poor due to particles\" from the extensive smoke coming from bushfires burning across the state.\n\nA photo posted to Reddit by user Sutkan shows the massive impact the smoke has had across Sydney.\n\nA picture taken of the city a few weeks ago shows clear blue skies, while one taken today shows the area covered in thick, brown smoke with very low visibility.\n\nAlmost 120 bush and grass fires are burning across NSW, with 48 uncontained and more than 1750 firefighters in the field.\n\nFirefighters on Monday rallied to save homes on the South Coast as fierce winds fanned a fast-moving fire which quadrupled in size in less than two days. The out-of-control fire at Currowan is burning across almost 25,000 hectares and is being pushed east towards coastal communities but tempered overnight as gusty north-easterly winds moderated.\n\nRFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons on Tuesday confirmed that properties west of Kioloa had been damaged and destroyed amid the blazes. Authorities would assess the extent of damage throughout the day.\n\nThe Currowan fire remains at \"watch and act\" alert level and evacuation centres have been set up at Ulladulla and Batemans Bay.\n\n\"We do have some early indications of property being lost or impacted to the west of the area of Kioloa, largely where the fire crossed the Clyde River there yesterday,\" Mr Fitzsimmons told the Seven Network.\n\n\"Unfortunately there's still a lot of very active fire edge on this fire, which is why it's remaining at watch-and-act alert level, and conditions could certainly change if we see the winds influence fire behaviour on that again.\"\n\nAn incredible photo of one of the blazes burning in the Blue Mountains shows just how close it was to the area's most iconic landmark, the Three Sisters.\n\nThe photo, which was shared by the NSW RFS shows the fire burning through bushland in front of the popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe Ruined Castle fire eased overnight but is starting to pick up again today on the eastern edge.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in Woodgate, south of Bundaberg in Queensland, have been told to leave as a nearby bushfire worsens.\n\nA fast-moving grass fire near Jarretts Road is travelling northwest, and is expected to impact the area between Heidkes Road to the end of Jarretts Road, bordered by the Gregory River.\n\nFirefighters say the blaze could have a significant impact on the community. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services have contained a blaze burning at Ravensbourne, north of Toowoomba.\n\nEmergency services earlier issued a prepare to leave warning for residents living near the fire.\n\n\"It is now safe for residents to return to the area, however, part of Ravensbourne Tip Road will remain closed overnight,\" QFES said on Monday night.\n\n\"People in the area will be affected by smoke, which will reduce visibility and air quality.\n\n\"Properties are not under direct threat at this time.\"\n\nDry and windy conditions have seen the fire danger rating classed as severe in parts of southern Queensland, as more than 50 fires burn across the state. Brisbane meteorologist David Crock said the weather on Monday is a repeat of the conditions experienced four or five times since the start of the fire season in September.\n\n\"That combination of hot, dry and windy weather is the worst fire weather that we see, so the fire agencies and firefighters are certainly up against it today,\" Mr Crock said.\n\nHigh temperatures are expected in far north Queensland early this week before pushing south, bringing maximums of around 40C in areas like the Lockyer Valley and Scenic Rim by the end of the week.",

freshest scats and then we call in the brilliant volunteers at the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital who are expert koala spotters.\"\n\nMr Tate has been an animal trainer all his life, but got into conservation detection dogs through his former work as a penguin trainer.\n\n\"I met Steve Austin who is a very famous and well established veteran dog trainer about 15 years ago,\" he said.\n\n\"I was actually working with penguins and Steve was training dogs to find penguins.\n\n\"He and I hit it off and I did a number of different courses with him and his wife and one thing led to another.\n\n\"I dabbled in work with explosives dogs, drug detection dogs, and truffle-sniffing dogs about four years ago I got asked to be part of a program with National Parks and I thought it might just be a summer fling but I've never looked back -- that's my full-time gig now.\"\n\nMr Tate has just become a father again but the early arrival of twins was in the middle of the bushfires.\n\n\"At one stage my wife and the twins were stuck at the hospital and we were stuck at home and unable to get to them, so it's been an extremely busy time of year for us,\" he said.\n\n\"But my wife and I are both hardcore conservationists and as soon as we saw what was happening around here we knew we had to dedicate and donate our skills and time to helping find what remaining koalas are here.\n\n\"So ever since the fires ripped through the Lake Innes area we've been on standby and we've gone in there on four occasions now and Taylor has been successful in locating eight koalas.\"\n\nPort Macquarie Koala Hospital President Sue Ashton said Mr Tate, who is now a member of the hospital, offered his and Taylor's services to help them in a search-and-rescue program.\n\n\"We never imagined that we would be using her in these fires, but it's just working so well,\" Ms Ashton said.\n\n\"Taylor's very speedy and very dedicated and covers a lot more area much faster than we do so it's been a great asset.\"\n\nThe Koala Hospital has had teams going out to the bushfire zones every day searching for burnt koalas and healthy koalas as well.\n\nMore than 30 koalas are being treated for burns at the hospital.\n\n\"What we're doing is treating their little paws and their noses and anywhere else that's burned,\" Ms Ashton said.\n\nThe hospital's GoFund Me campaign has already raised more than $1.8 million dollars.\n\nThat money will go towards more than 100 water stations for the Port Macquarie area where bushfires have devastated core koala habitat.\n\n\"We're working with NSW Forestry Corporation and National Parks to map the areas they need to go in to and we've also got a vehicle that we're going to use to top up these water stations as needed,\" Ms Ashton said.\n\n\"We're also getting some manufactured for our wildlife colleagues up in the Northern Rivers where they've been devastated by fire and also for wildlife organisations down south of us in Taree.\"\n\nCameras will also be installed to see what wildlife come to those water stations and how they help the wildlife population.\n\nThe Koala Hospital is also hoping to start the first wild koala breeding program in the world to try to rebuild the koala population.\n\nIt will probably be somewhere in Port Macquarie.\n\n\"That was a five to 10-year goal, we couldn't have done that without the massive support from the community,\" Ms Ashton said.\n\n\"It's now brought that goal forward and we're going to be focussing on that in the New Year.\"\n\nThe Koala Hospital will first have to find the land for the breeding program and then build infrastructure.\n\n\"There will be roads, there'll be fencing, there will be water and feeding stations, and there'll also be probably a clinic and a laboratory attached to it because we want to do this really well,\" Ms Ashton said.\n\n\"We are going to be working with a number of government departments and a lot of wildlife vets to make sure we use best practice, and then we get to share that knowledge with other organisations.\"",

        "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines for Dec. 2 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com\n\nA woman stranded in the Australian outback for nearly two weeks was miraculously found alive Sunday -- even as rescue efforts continued in the remote region for the 52-year-old's two friends who remained unaccounted for.\n\nThe Northern Territory Police said in a news release that Tamra McBeath-Riley was found after a vehicle the trio were traveling in was discovered in a riverbed southwest of Alice Springs. The group had left Alice Springs on Nov. 19 before the vehicle became bogged down in the riverbed.\n\nPolice Superintendent Pauline Vicary said at a news conference that McBeath-Riley found water about 1 mile north of the car.\n\n\"Sensibly she appears to have stayed where the water is and has been drinking that, and that's probably what kept her going,\" Vicary said.\n\nAUSTRALIAN FIREFIGHTER ACCUSED OF ARSON AMID BUSHFIRE CRISIS, POLICE SAY\n\nAn air search continued Monday for McBeath-Riley's friends -- Claire Hockridge, 46, and Phu Tran, 40 -- who reportedly left the waterhole to seek help.\n\nMcBeath-Riley said during a Monday news conference that on Thursday her friends began the 12-mile journey to reach a nearby highway, planning to avoid the desert heat -- which came close to 104 Fahrenheit in recent days -- by walking at night and carrying whatever water they could find.\n\n\"We tried many times to try to get out, but just couldn't get out, so ventured forth to try and find some shelter and some water,\" she said. \"The river was just too large, we couldn't get out.\"\n\nDuring the day, the group dug a hole underneath the car to stay cool and then slept in the vehicle at night, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. During that time period, the trio survived on six liters of water, 10 cans of iced vodka, a packet of biscuits and some beef noodles.\n\nAfter running out of supplies, they left a note on the car and made their way to the watering hole.\n\nMcBeath-Riley said she decided to stay at the waterhole with her Staffordshire terrier because she did not think the dog would survive a walk to the Stuart Highway, which connects Australia's north and south coasts. The group of women did not know if anyone was looking for them.\n\n\"When the helicopter found me, I thought that Claire and Phu had reached the highway,\" she told reporters. \"That was my immediate thought. So to find that's not the case is worrying.\"\n\nOfficials said McBeath-Riley was treated in an Alice Springs hospital for dehydration and exposure after she was found late Sunday. Her dog's status was not immediately clear.\n\nAUSTRALIAN ROBBERS' REPEATED FAILURE IN ATM SMASH-AND-GRAB CAUGHT ON CAMERA\n\nPolice said Monday that rescue efforts have \"ramped up,\" with two helicopters covering 14 square miles from the Stuart Highway, the general area where it is believed the pair may be. Vicary said that so far searchers had only found one set of footprints.\n\n\"It's quite a diverse terrain,\" she told reporters. \"There's sandy dunes, there's hard clay, there's areas of dense trees, but there are also rocks and ranges in the area.\"\n\nA local cattle rancher played a key role in saving McBeath-Riley, telling police he spotted tire tracks in an area that hadn't been searched.\n\n\"As a result of that information, we were able to locate the vehicle and then from there they have followed some of the other tracks and have located her,\" Vicary said.",

        "body": "At least one home on NSW's South Coast was destroyed by flames on Monday with firefighters concerned up to 10 homes could be in the path of the blaze.\n\nThe state's bushfire risk was heightened on Monday due to strong, damaging winds feeding 129 fires across the state.\n\nGusts reached 90km/h across the state and the highest recorded speed in Sydney 78km/h at the harbour.\n\n\"We have only seen a little bit of movement from the fires, which has been fortunate, across the fireground. The most movement has been on the fires burning near the South Coast,\" a RFS spokesman said.\n\n\"In the past 24 hours, we have seen more structural loss. The majority of this appears to have happened on the South Coast. It is still too dangerous to send the building impact inspectors in so we do not know the full extent of the damage.\"\n\n\"We need to figure out what has been destroyed, whether it is homes or outhouses, and we have only been able to get information from the aerial cameras.\"\n\nThe RFS confirmed at least one home had been destroyed by the Currowan fire, which has now burnt through with the blaze tracking towards more homes.\n\nThere is concern for at least 10 properties in the fire's path.\n\nCrews are preparing for property protection at Kioloa and Bawley Point with blaze expected to move towards them on Tuesday.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting the winds will drop but temperatures to rise this week.\n\n\"The wind is dropping on Monday evening and will be around 15km to 25km in Sydney around sunrise on Tuesday,\" BOM forecaster Schuang Wang said.\n\n\"They will remain as a westerly but temperatures will increase across the state on Wednesday and Thursday to around 28C or even 30C in some parts.\"\n\nFirefighters in Queensland are preparing for scorching conditions with 40C expected in Rockhampton, in central Queensland, on Tuesday and temperatures above 30C forecast for the rest of the state.\n\nSince July, bushfires have burnt through more than two million hectares in NSW.\n\nThere has been more than 7000 fires raging across the state in the \"most challenging bushfire season ever\".\n\nAmong the carnage six people have died while 673 homes and 1400 other buildings have been destroyed.\n\nShirley and Peter Redding say they had just minutes to evacuate their Kioloa home on the NSW South Coast on Sunday evening, as the Currowan bushfire broke containment lines and almost doubled in size under strong westerly winds.\n\nThe couple live just metres from the bush, and chose to leave their home under the advice of police and Rural Fire Service (RFS) crews, not knowing just how severe the fire had become.\n\n\"I got such a shock, our neighbour, she's a firey, she came across the road and said you've got to leave, you've got to get out,\" Mrs Redding said.\n\n\"We saw a lot of smoke but we didn't realise how close it was.\"\n\nBy Monday morning, the fire was burning out-of-control in the Bimberamala and Murramarang national parks and had jumped the Princes Highway, destroying more than 11,000ha of bushland.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, that number had increased to 16,000ha, with the fire quickly spreading east toward small coastal communities of Kioloa, Termeil, East Lynne, Bawley Point, North Durras and Pretty Beach.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Mr and Mrs Redding, who spent the night in Ulladulla after evacuating, were told fire retardant had been dropped over their home in an effort to protect it from the blaze.\n\n\"Our friend who stayed behind told us, we saw photos and there's pink everywhere,\" Mrs Redding said.\n\n\"We've never been in a situation like this and it's actually really, very scary,\" she said.\n\nWhile she, her husband and her two dogs were safe, Mrs Redding said they were very worried about their home, where they've lived for the past five years.\n\n\"I've never been so anxious in my life, I tipped a cup of tea all over the floor earlier,\" she said.\n\nEarly on Monday morning, the Princes Highway was closed between Termeil and the Kings Highway turn off, cutting access to coastal communities in the area.\n\nThe RFS warned those living in areas between Kioloa and North Durras, including Depot Beach, Pebbly Beach, Pretty Beach and Bawley Point, that it was too late to leave earlier this morning.\n\nLiza Butler, who lives in Bawley Point with her partner Barry and son Brendan was one of the residents who chose to stay home rather than evacuate on Sunday evening.\n\n\"We feel more comfortable here, and our place is pretty well cleared around it,\" she said.\n\n\"We prepared the house about two weeks ago, cleaned out the gutters, raked up all the bark and leaves because it's just so dry.\"\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Ms Butler said the wind hadn't picked up as much as what was anticipated, and that things \"seemed okay\" for the moment.\n\n\"It (the wind) comes and then it goes, it seems to pick up and die off,\" she said.\n\n\"It is smoky but it's not as bad as it was on Monday. It's kind of weird, we are just waiting.\"\n\nMs Butler said the main threat her family was facing on Monday afternoon was ember attack, but that they'd prepared to fight any spot fires.\n\n\"We've got buckets of water strategically placed around the place, wet towels ready to go,\" she said.\n\nWhile she hasn't had a lot of sleep, she was comforted by the fact RFS crews were driving around Bawley Point and keeping in constant contact with residents.\n\n\"We didn't sleep very much, we were up drinking tea at 1am after getting the emergency warning,\" she said.\n\n\"But I feel confident, the crews on the ground are erring on the side of caution and telling us to be ready, but I feel okay now because they are everywhere.\"\n\nBy late Monday afternoon, RFS crews said fire activity was increasing under strong, gusty north-easterly winds, and was burning toward Termeil. More than 100 firefighters and approximately 50 appliances are currently battling the blaze in a joint operation that includes RFS, fire and rescue, police and national parks.\n\nWater-bombing aircrafts could be seen flying over the eastern side of the highway for much of the afternoon, in an effort to slow the spread of the fire.\n\nThe emergency warning is expected to stay in place for some time, as firefighters work against difficult conditions.\n\nThere were 127 fires burning across the state. An out of control bushfire in the Blue Mountains is now under control.",

        "body": "Nearly 1800 firefighters and crew have worked through the night to slow the spread of a rapidly moving bushfire across NSW as conditions are set to worsen on Tuesday.\n\nNSW Rural Fire Service said fire danger was set for Very High in many parts of the state. It comes after firefighters battle to save homes from an out of control fire north of Batemans Bay that is burning across more than 16,000 hectares and is being pushed east towards coastal communities.\n\nOn Monday night residents had a nervous wait during gusty conditions with a warning in place.\n\n\"Winds have picked and the fire is burning in a north-easterly direction towards the area of Turmeil,\" the RFS tweeted on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in Woodgate, south of Bundaberg in Queensland, have been told to leave as a nearby bushfire worsens.\n\nA fast-moving grass fire near Jarretts Road is travelling northwest, and is expected to impact the area between Heidkes Road to the end of Jarretts Road, bordered by the Gregory River.\n\nFirefighters say the blaze could have a significant impact on the community. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services have contained a blaze burning at Ravensbourne, north of Toowoomba.\n\nEmergency services earlier issued a prepare to leave warning for residents living near the fire.\n\n\"It is now safe for residents to return to the area, however, part of Ravensbourne Tip Road will remain closed overnight,\" QFES said on Monday night.\n\n\"People in the area will be affected by smoke, which will reduce visibility and air quality.\n\n\"Properties are not under direct threat at this time.\"\n\nDry and windy conditions have seen the fire danger rating classed as severe in parts of southern Queensland, as more than 50 fires burn across the state. Brisbane meteorologist David Crock said the weather on Monday is a repeat of the conditions experienced four or five times since the start of the fire season in September.\n\n\"That combination of hot, dry and windy weather is the worst fire weather that we see, so the fire agencies and firefighters are certainly up against it today,\" Mr Crock said.\n\nHigh temperatures are expected in far north Queensland early this week before pushing south, bringing maximums of around 40C in areas like the Lockyer Valley and Scenic Rim by the end of the week.",

Four lives lost. Hundreds of houses gone. Who knows how this season will end.\n\nI've hardly written about the environment in my 40-year career. I've always figured it's better left to those with science expertise and a long history of reporting in the area. Now I realise I can't avoid it any more. Next year, one of my children has responded to a decade of nagging and will - finally - have a baby, the first grandchild on both sides.\n\nParts of our country have succumbed to the highest levels of air pollution from smoke ever recorded. In late November, Sydneysiders woke to a day with air quality conditions worse than Shenzhen, China and air quality ranked ninth poorest in the world.\n\nNo wonder I'm worried. An Indian study published in October showed that those children exposed to high levels of ambient air pollution demonstrate higher levels of small airway dysfunction. In other words, their tiny little passages can't cope. It's particularly true of children exposed to particulate matter, found in bushfire smoke.",

The lake sits behind Warragamba Dam, and accounts for about 80 per cent of Sydney's water supplies.\n\nStuart Khan, a University of NSW professor who has studied the threat from bushfires to water supplies, said previous blazes indicated there were \"some serious water quality risks for a major bushfire\" in Sydney's catchment.\n\nMajor infrastructure, such as pumps and the treatment plant at Prospect, are well away from the fires for now. Instead the \"key risk\" from the bushfires is they could produce large quantities of ash rich in organic carbon and phosphorous, he said. In addition, more carbon and phosphorous could end up in the reservoir, along with sediment, if the fires are followed by large rainfall events.",

We also ask that he watches over us, so that both parties might realise the courage to uphold the truth.\"\n\nBut Castle said she had been sent messages and emails from the rugby community supporting the decision to sack Folau.\n\n\"That leaves us in no doubt that we are doing what's right,\" she said. \"Israel's commentary subsequent to his termination has only reinforced this belief.\"\n\nCastle said a tribunal found Folau had committed a high-level breach of his contract and he had refused to curb his social media use.\n\n\"Rugby Australia is confident in its legal position but we come here today with a genuine desire to find a settlement that is sensible and reasonable so that we can return all our focus and resources to growing the game of rugby across Australia,\" she said.\n\nFolau is a hardline Christian who also recently claimed fatal bushfires were God's punishment for legalising abortion and same-sex marriage, sparking criticism from the prime minister, Scott Morrison.",

        "body": "\"The art of losing isn't hard to master.\"\n\nSince the NSW bushfires, the opening line from Elizabeth Bishop's great poem One Art feels remarkably apposite.\n\nBishop writes of loss and its acceptance, themes with a new and awful currency in the time of environmental collapse.\n\nFor this is an era in which, to borrow her words, \"so many things seem filled with the intent/to be lost\".\n\nWe've just watched koalas, creatures already at risk from deforestation, incinerated in their hundreds (perhaps thousands). We lost millions of other animals at the same time, and the devastation of habitats will doom more in the months ahead, especially since ecosystems that never previously knew fire now burn for weeks.\n\nThe Australian catastrophe mirrors events elsewhere.\n\nIn the past 40 years, more than half the world's wildlife has gone.\n\nRainforests are disappearing at the astonishing rate of 30 football fields a minute. Some estimates place 75% of coral reefs at risk from either local and global stress.\n\nAs David Wallace-Wells says, most of the carbon we've burned has been consumed since the premiere of Seinfeld. In the remarkably brief time bookended between now and a show about nothing, we've set in train the destruction of wonders that we barely comprehend.\n\nResearchers recently proved that bees perform basic arithmetic, a gobsmacking discovery with profound implications about the nature of intelligence. Yet in Europe some 800 varieties of wild bee species appear on the critically endangered list, a subset of the 40% of all insect species said to be in decline.\n\nWe know now that, like birds, reef fish sing a chorus to the sun each morning. We also know that, like birds, they're dying - fish populations throughout the oceans are decreasing precipitously.\n\nBishop describes personal calamities in a poem referencing her notoriously painful childhood. She barely knew her father; she was separated from her mentally ill mother at an early age.\n\nAfter inheriting a private income, she travelled widely, on journeys not always happy.\n\n\"I lost two cities, lovely ones,\" she writes,\n\n\"... And, vaster,\n\nsome realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.\n\nI miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.\"\n\nToday we cannot help but read those lines differently, with the devastation of cities, rivers and even continents an imminent prospect.\n\nVenice is flooding; the whole Murray-Darling basin is running dry; the Arctic (warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet) has been burning for months on end.\n\nWill we miss them? Will their destruction be a disaster?\n\nIn the face of inevitable bereavement, Bishop writes of the acceptance - even the cultivation - of loss.\n\n\"Lose something every day. Accept the fluster/of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.\"\n\nIn that way, she says, grief might become manageable.\n\nIt's a strategy that many of us adopt.\n\n\"We are on track,\" tweets the UN environment program, \"for a temperature rise of over 3°C. This would bring mass extinctions & large parts of the planet would be uninhabitable.\"\n\nWho can assimilate a warning like that? How do we go about our daily business knowing that unless something gives, much of the world will be ruined forever?\n\nLike Bishop, we adjust to small losses, one day at a time. We accept the strange absence of once common birds. We forget that, as children, we saw insects in great numbers and variety and now ... we just don't. We adjust our holidays to visit the forests that aren't burned, the reefs that haven't bleached.\n\nLike Bishop, we tell ourselves: \"None of these will bring disaster.\"\n\nBrecht, a more directly political writer, phrased the same thought somewhat differently in one of his anti-war poems.\n\n\"When evil-doing comes like falling rain, nobody calls out 'stop!'\n\nWhen crimes begin to pile up they become invisible.\"\n\nOr, at least, they become invisible for a while.\n\nIn the shattering conclusion of One Art, Bishop addresses directly the loss that haunts the poem: the absence of her lover.\n\n\"Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture\n\nI love) I shan't have lied. It's evident\n\nthe art of losing's not too hard to master\n\nthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.\n\nIn those lines the discipline of a very controlled poem collapses, precisely because, while some losses can be artfully mastered, others just cannot.\n\nThe catastrophe unfolding around us falls into the second category. Whatever coping mechanism we adopt, no ironic distance will normalise the ruination of a planet: a disaster that cannot - must not! - be borne.\n\n* Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist",

Israel Folau stirred controversy recently by claiming ongoing bushfires in New South Wales and Queensland were \"God's punishment\" for the legalisation of same sex marriage in Australia. Rugby Australia said the ongoing commentary and Mr Folau's refusal to apologise, reinforces their decision to terminate the embattled rugby union player's contract. Earlier this year, Rugby Australia terminated his multi-million dollar contract after a series of inflammatory posts on social media. Image: News Corp Australia",

With the NSW bushfires, you have to consider how the NBN can manage its risk when it comes to their infrastructure and provide a service to its customers, while ensuring its assets are secured.\"",

        "body": "BLUE Mountains school pupils are among a swag of volunteers helping to paint a clearer picture of air quality in our region.\n\nFifteen students at Katoomba Public School have been volunteering their lunchtimes to be part of Blue Mountains and Lithgow Air Watch -- a community-initiated year-long air-quality research project led by the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA).\n\nThe project, which includes monitoring local smoke haze, is now making publicly available real-time air-quality data from Springwood to Lithgow.\n\nThe information will help inform future initiatives to protect local air quality.\n\nAn EPA spokeswoman told The Blue Mountains News the project was triggered by interest from the Blue Mountains and Lithgow communities.\n\nLocals were seeking more information on air quality in their local areas, \"including the impacts from the transport corridor (Great Western Highway and freight trains)\".\n\nThe project includes collecting air quality data for 12 months using one temporary compliance air quality monitoring station at Katoomba and 12 low-cost air quality sensors, known as KOALAs, located at Katoomba, Lithgow, Springwood and Wentworth Falls.\n\nKids at Katoomba Public host and maintain one of these KOALAs, on their school grounds.\n\nKOALAs are solar battery powered and typically communicate air-quality readings at 30 to 40-minute intervals, showing the latest concentration of pollutants in the air.\n\nTeacher Cate Paterson said when the school, which already has a student volunteer environment group, was contacted by the Air Watch Project Steering Committee to be a part of this, \"we knew it was a great fit\".\n\n\"We have a water device on Vale St (which is monitored by our students) that captures the pollution run off from Katoomba St, to stop it from going into the Leura Falls catchment,\" Ms Paterson said.\n\nNow, once a month, the school's Air Watch volunteers \"come with a feather duster and they clean the top of the KOALA, because it's like a solar panel that measures local air quality\", she said.\n\nUsing a spreadsheet the pupils also record the smoke haze, so scientists from Western Sydney University who are analysing the data from the KOALAs and monitoring station can get a better understanding of the information coming back to them.\n\n\"Smoke from hazard reduction burns, bushfires and home wood-burning heaters contains particulate matter which is detected by the compliance monitor and the KOALAs,\" EPA's spokeswoman said.\n\nData from the 12 KOALA sensors is available in near real-time at bluemountains.sensors.net.au\n\nData from Katoomba air quality monitoring station is available on the DPIE website",
