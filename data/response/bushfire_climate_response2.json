        "body": "The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nIt is only mid-November but we have to walk early to avoid the heat. A northerly wind picks up clouds of dust and pollen, sending dirty billows across the paddocks. The long limbs of the gum trees groan overhead. Leaves and twigs litter the road. We stop to pull a branch off to the side.\n\nNot even summer yet and already we are facing our first catastrophic fire rating of the season. Normally, I don't even worry much about fires until after Xmas. In the southern states, it is January and February that are the most dangerous.\n\nWe live in the Adelaide Hills and never schedule holidays away from home in those months, even though it is hot and unpleasant. Now I'm worried we will have to cancel our pre-Christmas holiday plans. Winter will be the only time we can leave.\n\nWe cross paths with a friend walking her dog. We share mutual exclamations about the weather and the risk and she reminds me about the neighbourhood fire group meeting. I should go. I know, better than most people, just how important and lifesaving they can be. But I just don't want to.\n\nOn the weekend, my husband had made us start the fire pump. It's good to make sure it is all working, but I harbour a vague, irrational resentment at having to be taught how to do it every year. I know why. Mike has all that mechanical knowledge embedded in his brain like a primary instinct, but the information trickles out of mine like water through sand. I cannot rely on remembering what to do in an emergency.\n\nI know my limitations. I've attached a laminated, labelled diagram to the pump with numbered instructions on it. Leave nothing to chance. My daughters are running through the pump this year too - in case they find themselves home alone.\n\nFuel on, throttle on, choke on.\n\nI worry that the pull cord will be too hard, but my youngest yanks at it with practised determination and the pump starts first go.\n\nChoke off, throttle up, water on.\n\nThe sprinklers fire up a dull, thudding rhythm around the verandah, spraying a mist over the garden and the cat while Mike runs through the finer details of protecting the pump with a cover and sprinkler in the event of a fire.\n\nI watch the garden soaking up the unexpected bounty and notice that some of the plants have gone a bit leggy. Their undergrowth is woody with age. I'll have to cut that back, prune off the old growth. Some of them may have to go. Much as I love Australian plants and their waterwise habits, I can't have many in the garden. Most of them are just too flammable.\n\nEverything we do here, every decision we make, is shaped by fire risk: the garden, the house, our holidays, our movements, where we park the cars, our power and our water supply, even our telecommunications.\n\nIt is relentless. A friend of mine who went through Ash Wednesday said she was just tired, after 45 years, of the constant worry. She wanted to move somewhere safer. But she couldn't bring herself to leave the bush.\n\nPerhaps it would be easier not to know the risk, to live in ignorance.\n\n'Too busy'\n\nMy local fire brigade had an open day a few weeks ago. The volunteers were busy for days, cleaning the shed, preparing the sausage sizzle. Lots of new people have moved into the area, mostly from the city, and chances are they don't appreciate the risks of living in a bushfire-prone area.\n\nThe brigade put up signs, distributed flyers and knocked on doors with invitations. On the open day, I wander over and ask how many people have turned up.\n\n\"Oh about half a dozen,\" says the captain brightly, before adding, \"Well, maybe four actually. And only two of those are new.\"\n\nSomeone asks about a family who has moved into a property down the road, a younger couple with kids and a stay-at-home dad. Would he be interested in joining the fire brigade?\n\n\"Said he was too busy. Maybe later when the kids are older.\"\n\nThere are more and more people moving into the high risk urban fringes of our major cities, where houses mingle with flammable vegetation. Fewer and fewer people have the time or inclination to join their local volunteer fire brigade.\n\nMany of them commute for work. They think fire-fighting is what happens when you ring 000. They don't seem to realise that outside of the city, it is every community for itself. We have to fight our own fires.\n\nRead more: Grim fire season looms but many Australians remain unprepared\n\nI'm watching the news filled with images of the fires in New South Wales. Traumatised householders stand in front of the twisted wreckage of their homes. Tumbled masses of brick and iron are all that remain of a house full of memories.\n\n\"We never expected....\"\n\n\"I've never seen....\"\n\n\"I never imagined....\"\n\nNo matter how well prepared we are for fires, we always underestimate the scale of the loss - the photos, the family pets, the mementos and heirlooms, or simply the decades of work building a house, a property, a business.\n\nLooking at the television screen, I can't help but notice the blackened tree trunks next to the ruins of their homes. I worked for a while in community safety for the Country Fire Authority when we lived in Victoria, researching and writing reports, and later a book, on how people respond to bushfires.\n\nI'm well versed in the risk factors - proximity to native vegetation, fuel loads, clearance around houses, house construction and maintenance and most importantly of all, human behaviour.\n\nLeaving is not easy\n\nI used to live in a forest too, with mature eucalypts surrounding my house. We always knew this was a risk. We cleared the undergrowth and removed any \"ladders\" of vegetation that could allow ground fires to climb the trees. We removed new saplings growing close to the house.\n\nWe did as much as we could to make our 1970s home fire safe: installing sprinklers, sealing the roof, covering all the timber fascias in metal cladding.\n\nIn an average fire, we probably would have been fine. But when the Kinglake fires approached from the north on Black Saturday, I was no longer sure we would survive. A last-minute wind change swept the fire away from our home.\n\nLike many people, in and around the impact zone, the fires uprooted us and disconnected us. There were so many deaths, so many people and houses gone. And yet so many are still living in the same risky buildings, often rebuilt in the same risky locations. As if we never learn.\n\nWe no longer felt so attached to our home. When the opportunity to leave arose, we took it. When we moved to South Australia, we still wanted to live in the bush, despite the fire risk. But it seemed impossible to find a home that had been built for bushfire safety.\n\nA real estate agent showed me an elevated timber home that looked out to the south-west across vast hectares of native forest. A death trap if ever there was one.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed the agent. \"I'll just have to find a buyer who doesn't mind about that.\"\n\nOur new house is built of stone, steel and iron, with double-glazed windows and a simple roofline surrounded by sprinklers and hard paving. Every crack and crevice is sealed. And it sits in the middle of a cleared paddock surrounded by a low-flammability garden. We look out over the bushland from a safer distance.\n\nWhen my children were small, I packed them up and took them into town on every or total fire ban day. It was the prevailing advice from fire authorities. I cannot recall anyone else who did so - it is too hard, too disruptive and too inconvenient. And what do you do with the pets and horses and sheep? Let alone farms and businesses whose assets are practically uninsurable.\n\nBesides, there are so many total fire ban days and they are getting more and more frequent. We'd be leaving for all of summer soon and not everyone has somewhere safer to go.\n\nMy former colleagues at the CFA confirmed that few people take this advice to leave on total fire ban days. When the fire risk categories were upgraded to include \"catastrophic\", people simply recalibrated their fire risk range to suit.\n\nNow total fire ban days are everyday, ordinary events and people only talk about leaving if the risk is catastrophic or \"code red\". And even then, few of them do.\n\nThat's why fire agencies continue to put so much effort into teaching people how to stay and defend their homes - because that is where they are going to end up, no matter what they are told or what they say. After the shocking deaths on Black Saturday, urban politicians thundered in self-righteous fury.\n\n\"Why don't you just tell people to leave?\"\n\nLike it is that easy.\n\nOther people's fates\n\nI'm reminded of the neighbourhood fire safety programs. These are groups of neighbours in fire risk areas who meet up regularly to undertake training in fire preparation. They run in several states, such as Community Fireguard in Victoria, Community Fire Safe in SA and Community Fire Units in NSW.\n\nSome of the groups in Victoria have continued for years, often meeting annually just before the fire season to run through their plans and discuss issues they might be having. They share advice on how to protect properties, what to do when things go wrong, whose house offers the safest refuge, who is leaving and who is staying. They establish phone trees to warn everyone of imminent dangers and to stay in touch.\n\nI know these programs work. I surveyed many of the fireguard groups who survived Black Saturday and compared them to neighbours who weren't in groups.\n\nThe active members of fireguard groups were more likely to defend their houses. Active members' houses were also more likely to survive, even when they were not defended. A handful felt their training had not prepared them for the severity of the fires they faced. In truth, I don't think anyone, not even the most experienced firefighter, expected the severity of those fires. But the vast majority were certain their training helped, and had saved their lives.\n\nIn every group, there are people who do the work and those who don't. There are always neighbours who are too busy for the training and just ask for the notes, which they never read. They want to be on the phone tree, even though they have not prepared their property and have not thought about what they will do in an emergency. These \"inactive\" members do not seem to benefit from training. Their houses have the same loss rates as people who aren't in fireguard groups.\n\nNo matter how much other members of the group support them and encourage them, it does not help. I've tried to help before, running a fireguard group, but I don't want to do it again. I don't want to hold myself responsible for other people's fates. It is enough to take responsibility for myself and my family.\n\nI remember the fireguard trainers who blamed themselves, who were blamed by others, when neighbourhoods they had worked with suffered deaths and house losses. They often targeted the riskiest locations, areas that were virtually indefensible. Their information was not always accepted.\n\nTrainers, some of whom had lost friends, neighbours and houses in the fires themselves, felt criticised for advice that had not been given, and also for advice that had not been taken. You cannot defend yourself against such angry grief, particularly when you are carrying so much of your own. You just have to listen. A court of law, which looks only for someone to blame, is no place to resolve the complexities of bushfire tragedies.\n\nI had originally thought, when I wrote my book about bushfires, that it would be a simple analysis of the lessons we had learnt. After the Black Saturday fires, I had to write a completely different book. I realised it wasn't about lessons learnt (even though there are many), it was about our failure to learn from history, our astonishing capacity to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\nHarder and harder to protect people\n\n\"We never expected....\"\n\n\"I've never seen....\"\n\n\"I never imagined....\"\n\nThe same things are said after every fire. Blaming a lack of prescribed burning in distant parks when we know that preparation within 100 metres of our own homes is far more important.\n\nWaiting for an \"official\" warning, as an evil-looking, yellow-black cloud streams overhead and embers land sizzling in the pool beside you.\n\nPoliticians with slick, easy point-scoring ways that divert attention from their own policy obstruction.\n\nThe hopeful denial that bad things only happen to other people and won't happen to us.\n\nWe've just experienced the hottest year on record, and the second driest year on record. We have lost rainforests that have not burnt for millennia and may not recover. With climate change, fires have become more frequent across all the Australian states, and with more extreme weather events, they are likely to become even less predictable and more dangerous.\n\nThere is no avoiding the fact that for the next few decades, we face an increasingly dangerous environment. We have more people living in more dangerous areas, in a worsening climate. Our volunteer firefighters are ageing, and local brigades struggle to entice new members to join. It's getting harder and harder to protect people.\n\nIt would be nice if there was a silver bullet to protect us. If broad-scale prescribed burning in parks actually protected houses and lives, or if we had enough fire trucks and water bombers to save us all.\n\nIt would be great if we had a cohesive suite of integrated bushfire policies across states, strong enough to survive from one generation to the next. They could include adequate building standards and access to materials, effective planning and development codes, integrated municipal, state and federal strategies incorporating education, health and safety campaigns. We could create a culture of fire-awareness, rather than panicked responses to disasters followed by a long, inevitable slide into apathy and ennui.\n\nPerhaps one day we will. But in the meantime, our best protection lies in our own hands, safeguarding our own property and making carefully considered plans in advance as to how to save our own lives. It is not an easy path, and one none of us wants to take. But in the end, we are the only ones who can do it.",

        "body": "Delivering bad news to a market as flighty and circumstance-driven as it is right now was always going to be painful. And it was. In very quick time investors had belted Whitehaven's share price, knocking 11 per cent off its market capitalisation.\n\nWhitehaven management sheeted blame for the foreshadowed shortfall to an inability to find qualified workers to drive the heavy equipment at Maules Creek and to the routine interruption of normal business caused by dust, heat haze and smoke.\n\nIn part then, Whitehaven's downgrade declaration reveals a paradox of our climate worried times. Here we have a coal miner whose production is presently constrained by uncontainable forces that the wider community now consistently identifies as products of climate change - an enduring drought and wild bushfires.\n\nWhitehaven reported a series of unscheduled stoppages had been forced on Maules Creek through November and December by \"smoke, dust and haze events which are a function of ongoing severe drought conditions\".\n\nThat created the need for Whitehaven's trucks to drive a whole lot slower around Maules Creek than would be otherwise optimal and forced temporary production shuts through the worst of the conditions. And the Whitehaven guidance accounts for the potential of further weather and fire-related interruptions through summer's peak.\n\nFrom what we understand, the weighting of cause and effect here is that weather accounts for up to maybe 25 per cent of the cut to Whitehaven's guidance. The greater balance of the pruning of the outlook flows from the slightly counter-intuitive fact that Whitehaven cannot find enough people to ensure that it can deploy the full complement of the Maules Creek's shovel and truck fleet.\n\nThe inability to fill its rosters makes Maules Creek a study in contrast. It is a mining complex whose operating exactor and trucks are working at about 90 per cent of targeted productivity rates. But it is a mine where a shortage of workers means that equipment utilisation runs at circa 80 per cent.\n\nAnd, given the 25-75 per cent weightings above hold, then that translates into a 1.75mt shortfall in planned run-of-mine production.\n\nChief executive Paul Flynn has raised the spectre of skills shortages before. In talking to his annual profit back in August, Flynn assessed that infrastructure construction boom financed by state and federal government was vacuuming up skilled workers and releasing a new round of salary inflation.\n\nFlynn's August appraisal was preceded by the July publication of research by advisory firm BDO Remsmart that found there were at least 12 types of mining jobs that were attracting higher wages than at the peak of the last great resources boom.\n\nThe median remuneration for workers on that list, which included the excavator drivers that Flynn now needs, was more than $200,000 a year (including super).\n\nIt should be noted, though, that Maules Creek enters the tightening labour market with pressures that are very much its own.\n\nWhitehaven's social compact with its host communities is that it will source locally. It has fulfilled that commitment. Last year the business sourced $300 million of labour, services and goods from Gunnedah and its currently drought-blighted surrounds.\n\nBut there is a view that Maules Creek has tapped out the local people pool and that the mine's relative isolation has made it difficult to hire and retain skilled workers. Certainly, that thematic was reinforced by the mini-diaspora that occurred after a recent round of annual bonuses was paid to mine workers.\n\nApparently a small core of the Maules Creek workforce decided the time was ripe to return to their more urban Hunter Valley bases. That unanticipated loss and the inability to inspire a replacement migration of similarly skilled workers is effectively why management has been caught short of heavy haulage drivers.\n\nSo, probably but not certainly temporarily, Whitehaven is now looking to stretch its community compact by looking beyond the local region to meet its requirements.\n\nWhitehaven said it was \"actively pursuing a range of short- and medium-term options in conjunctions with employment service providers, mining service providers, local council and other to attract additional talent to the local area\".\n\n\"This multi-limbed strategy is necessary to ensure Whitehaven is well-positioned to deliver on its pipeline of local growth opportunities,\" the miner said on Thursday.\n\nNews that east coast gas markets have drifted from crisis to material oversupply lands welcome reinforcement of market theory.\n\nPrices that are consistently higher than long-run averages should invite new pools of supply or product replacement or both. And, given that new supply arrives at historically aligned production costs, the result should be lower prices for as long as the surplus is sustained.\n\nThankfully, for the time being at the very least, east coast gas markets have become a proof point for this cornerstone of free-market logic.\n\nA rare alliance of commercial rationality and well-intentioned, well-managed government threat has delivered the biggest east coast supply surplus since exports began in earnest in 2015.\n\nAccording to independent energy analysts EnergyQuest, the September quarter bought record east coast gas production of 500 petajoules (PJ). As a result, despite a material increase in east coast consumption, there was a domestic surplus of 17PJ.\n\n\"This is the largest east coast surplus since the beginning of LNG exports and a dramatically better outcome than Q3 2018, when there was a deficit of 17.9PJ,\" EnergyQuest reported.\n\nThe predictable result of a market in surplus is that prices have fallen. In its December energy market review, EnergyQuest reports that average short gas prices on the east coast fell by 7.8 per cent to $8.23 a gigajoule (GJ) through the third quarter of 2019 with prices running below trends of recent years across all of the key markets.\n\nFor the time being at least, the misplaced debate over whether or not east coast gas users are paying more than our export customers has been extinguished.\n\nEnergyQuest's data reveals that domestic prices are now running well below export parity and the jaws are only widening. \"Average domestic gas prices were about $8/GJ lower than export prices on both the east coast and west coast,\" EnergyQuest noted.\n\n\"In Q3 east coast short-term prices were lower than LNG realisations and the gap has widened,\" it reported. \"The average APLNG LNG price of $13.30/GJ compared with an average short-term price of $8.23/GJ, a difference of $5.07/GJ.\"\n\nImportantly, as we have already mentioned, the trend to declining prices has emerged despite consumption rising on the back, most particularly, of an 80 per cent increase in gas power generation in October.\n\nThere are not enough \"I told you so\" moments in life so we cannot let this opportunity pass without claiming this one.\n\nThrough the evolution of the east coast's gas dilemma, the position of this column has been that producers would inevitably respond to the price signal and new supply would find its way to market. But that conviction arrived with the caveat that nothing in the resources business happens quickly.\n\nOverall then, EnergyQuest's report offers insights enough, surely, for the government to again resist any temptation to deploy the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism and maybe even to resist any draconian reform of a weapon that was always going to work best by keeping it holstered.",

        "body": "Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions flatlined in the past year at 532 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.\n\nPep Canadell, senior principal research scientist at the CSIRO Climate Science Centre, said gross carbon emissions from natural fires had actually declined over the past century as fire-fighting practices and technology improved.\n\nHowever, the combination of worsening drought and more extreme fire conditions could lead to a \"breaking point\" after which both gross and net carbon emissions from natural fires could increase, Dr Canadell said.\n\n\"You can have as many helicopters as you want, but, at some point, it may be that extreme fire conditions become so common... that you'll be burning more than is regrown\".\n\nDr Canadell said he was unsure whether Australia had already reached this threshold, but that \"unprecedented\" disasters - such as the fires that wiped out Tasmania's ancient alpine ecosystems in 2016 - had already occurred.\n\nThe thousand-year-old trees destroyed in these fires, including pencil and king billy pines, do not naturally regenerate.\n\nBushfires have destroyed 800,000 hectares of national park in NSW this bushfire season, out of a total of 2.1 million hectares burnt across the state. There were over a hundred fires burning across NSW on Thursday.\n\nSwinburne University bioscience professor Mark Adams said he estimated bushfires in 2003 and in 2006-07 had released about 550 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.\n\nScientists declined to speculate on gross emissions from this ongoing bushfire season, citing incomplete information about what had been burned and to what extent.\n\nBut they noted the vegetation in northern NSW and Queensland, was less carbon-dense than the areas in Victoria and Canberra that were worst affected by those earlier fires.\n\nMartin Rice, head of research for the Climate Council, said he was unsure how the emissions footprint of natural fires would change, but that the \"root cause\" of the escalating bushfire risk was the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\"Climate change is not a thing of the future. It's human-induced, and it's happening now,\" Dr Rice said.\n\nAustralia has committed to reducing its carbon footprint by 26 - 28 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels, down to 441 - 453 million tonnes, but observers including the United Nations have questioned its ability to meet the target.\n\nEven if bushfires had a net positive contribution to carbon output, it would not count against the anthropogenic, or human-induced, measures of the national greenhouse accounts.\n\nBut Dr Canadell said changing conditions could reopen discussions on methods of carbon accounting.\n\n\"We cannot say bushfires are human-induced. But we can say that climate change is human-induced, and that it is having an effect on the fires,\" he said.",

        "body": "Waking in New South Wales this month has been a slow process of figuring out whether or not the fires have come to your door.\n\nThe smoke, worst in the mornings usually, but increasingly thick at night, has become a familiar presence. On bad days, it is inside homes and cars and offices. It could be from down the road, or hundreds of kilometres away. On other days, it can be hard to tell whether thin, mild smoke is really there, or is just a trick of the light. At sunup and sundown, the sky becomes bright orange and red and angry. At night, the moon is orange.\n\nIn Sydney cafes, people wedge the door closed as though they are keeping out the cold, even when it is nearing 30C outside.\n\nReaders have told Guardian Australia they have put tape around their doors, bought complex air filters, and hung wet towels above their childrens' beds.\n\nOne person from the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, said they had suffered lung collapses as a result of aggravated asthma fits, requiring a drain in their chest \"for several days\". Another, on the mid-north coast of NSW, said their GP had confirmed five weeks of smoke had exacerbated their lung conditions, \"to the point where it could be affecting my heart\".\n\nA Sydney GP, Kim Loo, said she was seeing a stream of patients on bad air quality days with \"nasal symptoms, sinus symptoms and sore throats\".\n\nAt a time when people are usually looking forward to their post-Christmas summer holidays, this year the outlook is grim.\n\nBrian Fairweather lives on Sydney's northern beaches. He emigrated from Boston 23 years ago, fleeing the cold winters. \"I haven't seen a winter in 23 years and I'm very happy about that,\" he tells Guardian Australia. \"I love summer.\"\n\nBut on Thursday, he took his family to the beach. \"I was driving towards Dee Why and I was thinking this is going to suck if it is this whole summer. It was worse at the beach than it was back home.\"\n\nNow, the father of three says the air qualityis a worry.\n\n\"We live surrounded by a national park and both myself and my daughter have to use an inhaler. So we had to go buy her a new one. I had to tell them, 'why don't you go inside and watch TV for a while'. It's the opposite to what I would normally say.\n\n\"I love Sydney, I moved here and decided to stay. It's an amazing place because of what you can do in the summer time, people wait for the summer to come out to really enjoy Sydney. It's a shame to think people are either going to be sick or uncomfortable.\"\n\nBrisbane resident Sheila Harmes agrees: \"I love summertime,\" she says. \"But this year will probably make sure I stay inside.\"\n\nHarmes, who has chronic bronchitis, says she moved to Australia from Britain 29 years ago, largely for the weather. Now, for the first time in Australia, her condition is back. After a short walk, she says, she was unwell for two weeks.\n\n'End of days' feeling\n\nThe smoke has funnelled into Sydney from large bushfires in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury area north and west of the city. Those fires represent only a fraction of the hundreds that have turned the spring of 2019 into one of the most devastating bushfire seasons eastern Australia has known in terms of the area of land burnt.\n\nBy the end of November, 1.9m hectares had been burnt in New South Wales alone, including 800,000 hectares in national parks - 10% of the state's total national park area. Twenty per cent of the Blue Mountains world heritage area has been affected by fire.\n\nQueensland has also suffered badly, with 38 homes destroyed in this bushfire season. Almost 200,000 hectares have been burnt in the state since the start of September, and more than 2m hectares in New South Wales - a combined area larger than actual Wales.\n\nSouth Australia and Western Australia have also experienced dangerous fires, and many are still burning on the east coast. Between 1 July and 29 November, there have been 7,530 individual fires in NSW. Six people have died in NSW, and more than 600 homes destroyed - 4,700 homes have been saved by firefighters.\n\nThere is no sign the conditions will let up over the summer months. The Bureau of Meterology has said the hot and dry conditions will continue, leading to more severe fire danger warnings over Christmas and into 2020.\n\nThe fire season in Victoria typically comes later, and fire chiefs fear resources will be stretched beyond endurance if the southern state experiences a bad season while fires are still raging further north. Australia's worst recent bushfire catastrophe came in February 2009, when 180 people died as conflagrations raced through small towns north of Melbourne.\n\nThe extent of the fires and the smoke that has drifted across Sydney and many other affected areas - combined with the seemingly endless drought in many areas of the country - have led to widespread fears that Australia is heading towards an ominous, apocalyptic time.\n\nThe actor Sam Neill tweeted that there was a sense of \"the end of days\" about the country seen from the air, as his plane approached on Tuesday.\n\nIn a Climate Council report released the same day, the organisation warned the Australian summer would be a \"terrible trifecta of heatwaves, droughts and bushfires\" that would bring with it a range of health problems from heatstroke, to breathing difficulties and mental health issues.\n\n\"The catastrophic events that are unfolding in Australia are not normal. Now is the time to act decisively and swiftly by deeply and rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing our fire and emergency services and communities for worsening extreme weather events,\" the report said.\n\nMore immediately, the smoke haze has prompted warnings of poor air quality, due to ultrafine particles, or pm 2.5, which travel for hundreds of kilometres and linger in the air.\n\nAccording to data from the NSW Department of Environment, Sydney is experiencing much higher rates of pm 2.5 than normal. Australia's national standard is less than 8 micrograms/m³ of ultrafine particles, but in recent days Sydney has been blanketed by smoke, and has recorded up to 180 micrograms/m³.\n\nAn analysis of the data shows no higher recordings over the past 10 years for Sydney.\n\nOn the Air Quality Index, which also encompasses other pollutants, a reading below 100 is considered \"fair\" and safe by NSW Health. Over 150 is considered \"very poor\", and over 200 is \"hazardous\".\n\nAcross Prospect in Sydney's west, Randwick in the east, and in the city centre, the six days between 28 November and 3 December were all over 100, with a high of 523 in Randwick. In Prospect, on 19 November, an astonishing peak of 2,593 was recorded. Two days later, it was 1,699. In Randwick that same day, it was 531, and in the city centre 707.\n\nFay Johnston, associate professor of environmental health at the University of Tasmania, has been studying the impact of bushfires on health for nearly 20 years. She says Sydney and New South Wales have seen air quality this bad before, but not over such an extended period.\n\n\"I don't recall an episode in New South Wales that has gone on for so long at these levels.\n\n\"That's new to me, to have such severe pollution that is going on for weeks now.\"\n\nThe smoke has led to a spike in hospital admissions, and ambulance call outs, but the longer the pollution events, she says, the worse the health effects are.\n\n\"Not only does it exacerbate what conditions you might have, and make you sicker from those, it makes you a bit like a smoker. It makes you develop heart disease and irritates your lungs,\" Johnston says.\n\n\"The death rates from long term exposure to air pollution are more than if you just add up the death rates you would expect from a bad day in a particular location.\"\n\nThe smoke particles can cause reactions all over your body, she says.\n\n\"The particles are so tiny they set off reactions throughout the body, like a stress reaction, makes your blood more likely to clot, makes your heart more stressed.\n\n\"Which means if you're at very high risk of heart attack, it can be the precipitant.\"\n\nThat may be a rare outcome, but in a city of 5m there are quite a few people in those high risk states, she says.\n\n'Summer is likely to get more dangerous'\n\nThe long term impacts of the smoke are unknown, Johnston says.\n\n\"What we don't know with fires is how much is too much, and how long is too long, because there is just no long term research,\" she says.\n\nJohnston has researched the health impact on children arising from the Hazelwood coalmine fire in Victoria in 2014, which lasted longer than 45 days and caused worse air quality conditions than Sydney is currently experiencing. It has shown unborn children and those under the age of one in the Morwell area have had stiffer lungs and more coughs and colds during their childhood.\n\n\"It's a tiny effect ... it might not be of huge clinical importance, but the fact that we measured it means we need to take it seriously and if you're able to reduce the exposure of children and pregnant women, it is responsible.\"\n\nThe executive director of the Climate and Health Alliance, Fiona Armstrong, says that as climate change exacerbates the conditions in summer, the effects on health will become more noticeable.\n\n\"It's really the extreme weather events that are going to have the biggest impact on people's health,\" she says.\n\n\"Over the long term - I guess you could say summer is likely to get more dangerous for people's health.\"\n\nFor now, Johnston says, the best people can do is to limit their exposure. Face masks have proliferated in city streets, although experts recommend that in most cases they are all but useless to protect against the tiny particles carried by bushfire smoke. Johnston advises people to stay in air-conditioning where possible, such as in the office or a library.\n\nThe stereotypical beachside Australian summer seems a long way off.",

The lower Hunter and Central Coast also had hazardous air quality.\n\n\"An overnight temperature inversion will trap the smoke in the Sydney basin. This means smoke will settle in many areas and be very heavy,\" the RFS said in a statement.\n\nThe environment department says this season's bushfire emergency has caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen in NSW\".\n\n\"Recently NSW has experienced elevated levels of pollutants as a result of smoke from the bushfire emergency, and dust caused by the severe drought,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"NSW has experienced other periods of poor air quality that lasted several weeks, including the 1994 Sydney bushfires and the Black Christmas bushfires of December 2001 to January 2002.\n\n\"This event, however, is the longest and the most widespread in our records.\"\n\nWinds averaging up to 50km/h are expected on Thursday along with gusts of up to 80km/h across the ranges, with Friday expected to be worse again.\n\nThe RFS has issued widespread total fire bans for Thursday including the greater Sydney, Greater Hunter, Illawarra/Shoalhaven, far south coast, Monaro Alpine, southern ranges and central ranges fire regions. The northern slopes and north- western fire regions are also under a total fire ban.\n\nAustralia recorded its lowest level of rainfall for the month of November, the country's weather bureau said on Thursday.\n\nAll of Australia received less then 50 mm (1.9 inches) of rain during November, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said, with parts of the west coast receiving less than 1 mm.\n\nThe dry weather extends a drought that has gripped Australia's east coast for three years and left bushland tinder-box dry as bushfires rage across the most populous states.\n\nThe dry weather is not expected to break for at least another three months, BOM said last week, heightening the risk of more bushfires.\n\nThe crisis has put pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison as critics say the Australian leader has not done enough to address the impact of climate change, which meteorologists have said was extending the length of the fire weather season.\n\nAs well as bushfires, the dry weather has also had a devastating impact of Australia's agriculture sector.",

        "body": "LEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: Kevin Rudd, thanks for your time.\n\nKEVIN RUDD, FORMER PRIME MINISTER: Good to be with you.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Is China respecting Australia's sovereignty?\n\nKEVIN RUDD: I think China's starting point is to respect the sovereignty of foreign powers but, like other states in history, China seeks to influence those powers in a manner which would make them ultimately more amenable to China's interests and values.\n\nBut when China does so, and it looks at Australia, it looks at the nature of our defences, it looks also at the nature of our own domestic resilience, but it also looks at the fact that we have an alliance with the United States.\n\nThese things, as it were, shape the environment within which China seeks to influence events in Australia.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Is it something that the ordinary Australian citizen should be worried about?\n\nKEVIN RUDD: To be frank, having been this country's prime minister before, various countries in our history have sought to influence our decision-making processes.\n\nSome you might say are more familiar - the United States, the United Kingdom - others as well.\n\nSo this is not, in that sense, new. China, of course, as the rising global power is seeking to deploy as much of its influence as possible.\n\nThose who are in the first line of receiving this are China's 14 neighbouring states, where China wishes those to become more compliant to Chinese interests and values.\n\nWe are somewhat down the line from that.\n\nSometimes in Australia we think we're Robinson Crusoe - we're not. Other countries are going through the same experience as us.\n\nLEIGH SALES: We are getting some conflicting messages about China's efforts to influence Australian politics and society. The nation's security agencies are warning that it is unprecedented and dangerous.\n\nPeople such as the former prime minister, Paul Keating, say it's an hysterical overreaction. Where do you stand on that?\n\nKEVIN RUDD: I have always had a fairly sober view of these things and in our period in office, we were very much conscious of China's interest in Australia.\n\nChina's interests, economic and security, in this country and also China's desire through diplomatic and other processes to try and create a more favourable environment for itself.\n\nSo, I don't think it's, I don't think we can be naive about this. It is real but at the same time, it's kind of crazy to overreact and to get into reds under the bed land, to get into yellow peril land.\n\nI support what the Morrison Government has done with the Foreign Influence Transparency Act. That has been passed with bipartisan support from the Australian Labor Party and I think that should be executed and implemented in a legal and administrative fashion, but it should not result in some sort of anti-Chinese domestic political witch-hunt.\n\nSo we have got to be very balanced about this and not overreact. Sometimes I come here and I sense there is just a little bit too much hysteria in the wind.\n\nLEIGH SALES: There was a photo of you in Beijing last week shaking hands with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping at a summit. What are you hearing from China's leadership about their thoughts about the Morrison Government?\n\nKEVIN RUDD: Well, I'm not in the business of disclosing diplomatic conversations, that is the bottom line.\n\nI've actually spent some time with Mr Morrison, the Prime Minister, since his re-election to discuss what is frankly a difficult challenge for Australia, whatever our politics happen to be - that is, Liberal or Labor, on crafting a long-term strategy for dealing with China's rise.\n\nWe experienced this when we were in office. China has risen further in the last several years under Xi Jinping and so Mr Morrison's challenge is difficult, just as the one that we faced when we were in office was difficult as well.\n\nI was in Beijing with Henry Kissinger, Hank Paulson, the former US Treasury secretary and others. We had about an hour or so with Xi Jinping talking about the future of the Chinese economy and China's attitude to a range of countries adjacent to it, including Japan.\n\nAustralia did not come up but more broadly, it is true. We are going through a very difficult period.\n\nSome of those are self-inflicted wounds by the current conservative government, others are a product of, shall we say, China's structural rise and the sorts of pressures which all of China's neighbours in the region and beyond are beginning to feel.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Do you think that Australia's political donation laws, as they stand, are a potential gap for foreign influence, not just China's?\n\nKEVIN RUDD: Look, I have been a long-term advocate of tightening our political donation laws as much as is humanly possible.\n\nBack in 2009, John Faulkner and I tried to put laws through the Senate and the House of Representatives, which would ban all foreign donations way back then. That is only very recently happened in Australia, which I think is a travesty.\n\nThat is because Malcolm Turnbull's Liberals opposed our law then but the second reform we tried to bring in was to put a cap of $1,000 on all individual donations to Australian political parties.\n\nAgain, that was killed by the conservatives 10 years ago.\n\nI think we need to look, Leigh, at the Canadian laws for political donations which keeps restrictions very tight on what can be donated, but also puts a cap on how much can be spent in an individual electorate and in a total national campaign.\n\nOtherwise, whether it's an external donation from a China-related source or somewhere else, or frankly a person like Clive Palmer's ability to walk in and massively influence an election because he happens to be a billionaire, that's not what Australian democracy is supposed to be.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Just on some other matters before we run out of time. The recent bushfires in Australia have sparked a lot of discussion about the nation's response to climate change.\n\nAustralia is responsible for only a little over 1 per cent of global carbon emissions and therefore, even if we had the best emissions reduction policy in the world, it wouldn't stop drought and bushfires and floods and so on.\n\nSome people cite that fact as an argument for Australia not doing more on climate change in a policy sense.\n\nAre they correct to do so?\n\nKEVIN RUDD: This is straight out of the climate change denialist and minimalist handbook, this sort of argument.\n\nFirst things first, I mean we are a massive exporter of carbon to the rest of the world. It doesn't have to be counted in our national emissions, which come in at about number 15 worldwide. But we're a massive exporter of carbon the other countries as well, which gets counted in those countries' national greenhouse gas emissions. That is point number one.\n\nPoint number two is that if we, through the Morrison Government, continue to adopt a policy which is, it ain't really our problem, it's all those other countries' problem, and we intend to free load on the international system, guess what, Leigh? Every other country, big and small, including the Chinese themselves, the world's largest emitters, say, \"Well, if those guys aren't pulling their weight, why should we?\"\n\nAnd you see, the thing for Australia is we have got to pull our national weight so that we can be effective leaders in causing the other big emitters to pull their weight and do more as well.\n\nIt's only through that sort of leadership that we make a material difference for this country of ours, which we've seen on fire for the last month or so, for goodness sake.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Kevin Rudd, thank you very much for your time this evening.",

        "body": "Why worse wildfires? The short answer is more humans cause more wildfire ignitions in altered landscapes. Since 1970, California's population doubled, adding 20 million people. As more human habitat was developed, the increasingly disturbed landscape quickly became covered in easily ignitable invasive grasses (see part 1). To protect human habitat, fires were suppressed and ground fuels increased. Development also expanded a vulnerable electric grid. Furthermore, more people increased the probability of careless fires and more innocent accidents. And sadly, a larger population added more arsonists.\n\nDuring a typically warm and dry July day, a rancher was innocently driving a stake into the ground to plug a wasp's nest. Surrounded by dry grass, the hammer's spark ignited a devastating inferno named the Ranch Fire. Despite sensationalist's hype, global warming had not made the grass drier. Grass becomes highly combustible in just a few hours of dry weather. And like most of northern California, there has been no warming trend for maximum summertime tempertures. Based on Western Regional Climate Center data, maximum summer temperatures in the Mendocino area had cooled by 3°F since the 1930s. The rapidly spreading Ranch Fire soon merged with a different fire to form the Mendocino Complex Fire, California's largest documented fire.\n\nSimilarly, a highway accident sparked roadside grasses that kindled northern California's 7th largest fire, the Carr Fire.\n\nCareless fires cannot be considered accidents and offenders should be held accountable. A hunter's illegal and improperly attended campfire caused the August 2013 Rim Fire, centered around Yosemite National Park. It was California's 5th largest fire.\n\nGovernments and utility companies should likewise be held accountable for carelessly maintaining our electric grids. An electric spark ignited California's deadliest fire, the Camp Fire which destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. As a 2018 research paper estimates, \"Since the year 2000 there've been a half-million acres burned due to powerline-ignited fires, which is five times more than we saw in the previous 20 years.\"\n\nMore disturbing is the number of fires started by arson. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, nationally, as in California, one in every five brush, grass, or forest fires since 2007 were intentionally set. Arsonists have been recently charged for some of California's 2019 fires. Arson accounted for 55% of Kentucky's fires and is the leading cause of Florida's fires. Because arson is so difficult to prove, arson statistics are probably underestimated. So, experts in Australia combine arson and \"suspicious\" fires to argue half of Australia's fires were likely intentionally set. That means each year 31,000 Australian bushfires are intentionally ignited. And as in the American west, Australia's bush fires have been increasingly fueled by invasive grasses like Buffel grass.\n\nWildfires caused by natural lightning ignitions, peak during the summer months of July and August, and become virtually non-existent in the autumn and winter. In contrast, human ignitions have created year-long fire seasons. Counter-intuitively, California experiences the most dangerous fire weather during the cooler and wetter seasons. As seasonally cold air settles in over the high mountain deserts in autumn and winter, episodes of high winds, known as the Santa Ana and Diablo winds, flow downslope. Sinking air warms 5°F for every 1000-foot drop in elevation so these downslope winds can raise lowland temperatures 25°F in just a few hours. That warming causes relative humidity to fall, so these winds rapidly suck moisture out of whatever vegetation it passes over. In combination with faster spreading embers, fires burn 2 to 3 times more area during high wind events.\n\nUnder natural conditions, seasonally extreme winds never coincided with the season of abundant lightning. But due to human ignitions there has been an increased probability of more ignitions occurring during strong cool-weather winds. California's 2nd biggest fire, the Thomas fire, was ignited in December by a downed power line during high winds. The third largest fire, the Cedar Fire was ignited in October by a lost hunter who carelessly lit a signal fire. California's deadliest fire, the Camp Fire, was ignited by a powerline and fiercely spread due to a November high wind event.\n\nClimate change does not ignite fires. Climate change does not affect how quickly dead grasses and bushes can dry. Climate change may affect the winds, but any warming, natural or human, would reduce those extreme winds. Regards California's worst fires, a US Geological Survey's wildfire expert states, \"Some will argue that it's climate change, but there is no evidence that it is. It's the fact that somebody ignites a fire during an extreme [wind] event.\"",

        "body": "The yellow spots and discoloured leaves of this red lilly pilly are signs the invasive fungus myrtle rust has infected it.\n\nWhile cane toads creep across northern Australia and down the eastern coastline, a far more insidious invasive species is ravaging our native trees.\n\nScientists warn rapid extinctions of some of our most well-known tree species are on the cards if myrtle rust, an invasive, disease-causing fungus, is not rapidly brought under control.\n\nMyrtle rust, or Austropuccinia psidii, has caused extensive dieback of trees including lilly pillies, paperbarks, box brush and tea trees.\n\nThe areas most affected are wet forest environments, such as coastal heath, paperbark wetlands and rainforests, along the east coast of Australia, said Bob Makinson, a conservation botanist with the Australian Network of Plant Conservation.\n\n\"We know that at least four species are in what can only be termed catastrophic decline,\" Mr Makinson said.\n\n\"The critical endangered status that's been afforded to three of those species in New South Wales means that they are in danger of extinction in the near future.\n\nNative guava (Rhodomyrtus psidioides) and brush turpentine (Rhodamnia rubescens) are two of the four tree species most at risk from myrtle rust.\n\n\"Those species were widespread and had no conservation concern prior to 2010, when myrtle rust was first detected,\" Mr Makinson said.\n\n\"But in the short space of just nine and a half years have gone to critically endangered status.\"\n\nMyrtle rust is now established along the east coast of Australia and at several locations in Tasmania and the Northern Territory, but has not yet reached Western Australia.\n\nMyrtle rust is recognisable by its yellow and orange spores on tree leaves and branches.\n\nThese spores are carried by wind, and when they land on a suitable host -- trees in the family Myrtaceae -- they can infect it within 12 hours.\n\nSometimes the only sign trees are infected is isolated brown spots on their leaves, and some plants can survive with this level of infection.\n\nMore severely infected plants look burnt and this level of infection can cause plant death.\n\nPlant pathologist Geoff Pegg called myrtle rust the \"pinnacle of pathogens\" at a recent Ecological Society of Australia conference in Launceston.\n\n\"Initially we thought that [myrtle rust infection] would be mainly in areas where we have regeneration -- so seedlings,\" said Dr Pegg, who works in forest production and protection with the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.\n\n\"We're losing the lower branches first and the plants just struggling to survive by having only the top of the canopy still alive. But it's eventually succumbing as well.\"\n\nOver 350 species of Myrtaceae can be suitable hosts to myrtle rust, and it's not clear why, according to Dr Pegg.\n\n\"[Myrtaceaea] is such a diverse thing, some species have spiny little leaves, and others have massive fleshy leaves, and there just doesn't seem to be difference in terms of their susceptibility,\" he said.\n\nThe invasive rust also targets fruit and flowers and with repeated infection of new growth over time, trees are no longer able to reproduce and eventually die.\n\nAt one of Dr Pegg's study sites in Lennox Head in northern New South Wales, Myrteacea species that once dominated the site did not regenerate after fire.\n\n\"The prickly melaleuca, Melaleuca nodosa, was once dominant and grew in thickets, now we only find one or two individuals within those thickets, and it's been swamped by acacias and banksias,\" he said.\n\nWith huge bushfires burning throughout Australia this spring, and predictions of more frequent and intense fires due in some part to climate change, will the threat of myrtle rust increase?\n\n\"Because you get a massive amount of regenerating seedlings which is susceptible to myrtle rust, you will potentially get a rapid increase in spores, increase in the number of plants infected and severity of impact on species.\"\n\nMyrtle rust is not yet affecting eucalypts to the same extent as other Myrtaceae groups, but that could change, Mr Makinson said.\n\n\"Myrtle rust has different strains, and there are two strains in South America, which are strongly eucalypt associated and have caused major economic damage in the eucalypt plantations over there,\" he said.\n\n\"If either of those strains or indeed any others were to arrive in Australia the effects could be quite dire.\"\n\nIn mid-2018 a roadmap for the conservation response to myrtle rust was drawn up by a group of concerned scientists, led by Mr Makinson, with support the Department of Environment and Energy and the previous Plant Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre.\n\nCollecting germplasm -- cuttings or seeds -- from Myrtaceae is one of the actions recommended, as there aren't any safe refuges due to myrtle rust dispersal via wind.\n\nSamples collected could be used to identify plants that are more resistant or tolerant to the rust, which could be used to breed resistant lines of those species for putting back out into the wild to reinforce surviving populations or as reintroductions where extinction has occurred.\n\nHowever, Mr Makinson said this plan is yet to be taken up or resourced.\n\n\"This is an existential threat to plant family of great ecological significance in Australia and indeed have commercial significance too,\" he said.\n\n\"One would hope that a vigorous reaction to the arrival of one strain in Australia would would emerge and would prepare us better for future strains that might arise as well.\"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the federal environment minister Sussan Ley said the draft action plan was being finalised by the Australian Plant Biosecurity Science Foundation following public consultation.\n\nThe statement also said that two of the four species of Myrtaceae currently in \"catastrophic decline\" due to myrtle rust in New South Wales and Queensland have been prioritised for assessment under the Environment Protection and Biosecurity Conservation Act.",

        "body": "Related Story: For every square kilometre in this 'pristine' region of Australia, there is a feral cat\n\nAs scientists predict bushfires will become more frequent and intense, a simple design could help small native mammals, birds and reptiles survive the ordeal of fire in greater numbers.\n\nResearch shows that when fire scorches a landscape, feral predators such as cats and foxes can pose a greater risk to animals' survival than the fire itself.\n\nConservation scientists across the country are testing whether simple, cheap structures could help those small native animals stay safe in the aftermath of fire.\n\nDeakin University PhD student, Darcy Watchorn, has been among ecologists focused on trying to stop the \"widespread population loss\" of native animals that are killed by invasive predators, including foxes and feral cats, in the wake of fires.\n\n\"The impacts of these invasive predators are really amplified by fire,\" he said.\n\n\"You have cats and foxes predating on the landscape generally and then when a fire comes through that landscape, a lot of the small terrestrial mammals are really exposed because the groundcover is now absent.\n\n\"Instead of having a thick forest with lots of shrubs and trees you have now essentially got bare earth. It's blackened.\"\n\nMr Watchorn's work examined the effectiveness of simple shelters made of chicken wire and shadecloth, and has been undertaken in the Great Otway National Park along the coast south-west of Melbourne, where the feral cat population is estimated to be three times the national average.\n\nHe said studies have shown that invasive predators become more active in areas that have been burnt.\n\n\"More cats and foxes will come into those areas and increase their predation rate on animals that have survived the fire,\" Mr Watchorn said.\n\n\"You've got these two massive threats working in conjunction with one another, so together they represent a really formidable challenge in conserving these animals.\n\n\"It's amplified by the already highly fragmented landscapes and populations [of some species] that are remaining.\n\n\"A lot of our mammals are only existing in small populations or in really fragile habitat. There might not be much habitat remaining for that species, so the impact on that wildlife can be more damaging.\"\n\nRecent bushfires in New South Wales have cast the spotlight onto the impact blazes have on larger animals such as koalas, resulting in millions of dollars being raised for the Port Macquarie Animal Hospital.\n\nBut while it is known events like Victoria's devastating Black Saturday fires a decade ago have the capacity to kill and injure hundreds of thousands -- or even millions -- of animals, the effect on small vertebrates such as rodents, birds and reptiles is sometimes overlooked.\n\nMr Watchorn is halfway through his two-year study into how effective the wire shelters are.\n\nHe has 15 separate 50-metre-long shelters set up in the Great Otway National Park, in bushland near Anglesea, and each shelter has a wildlife camera set-up to record which animals are making use of the structures after planned burns.\n\nThe early results have been promising, and he planned to set-up more shelters in a section of the park that was more rainforest-like near the town of Lorne early next year.\n\n\"In the burnt environment the shadecloth provides cover and ideally, acts like vegetation would,\" he said.\n\n\"The idea is that they're connecting patches of unburnt vegetation, to reduce the risk of predation and also give them a refuge to escape to.\"\n\nThe cameras have shown the refuges being used by rodents, agile antechinus, ground-dwelling birds such as fairy wrens, scrub wrens and thornbills and also reptiles.\n\nUniversity of Sydney ecology professor, Chris Dickman, has spent six years testing out the same shelters in Central Australian desert conditions in western Queensland.\n\nHe said the \"above-ground tunnels\" are cheap and low-tech and using them in desert environments resulted in a \"strong behavioural response\" from small native animals.\n\n\"We know they work in the open desert environment but we need a little bit more understanding of how well they might work in more densely vegetated environments,\" Dr Dickman said.\n\nScientists, including Mr Watchorn, have been testing the shelters in fire-affected natural environments in South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria, and hoped that if they were effective they would be used by authorities in the wake of bushfires.\n\n\"Fire behaviour models seem to be suggesting that for many parts of the country, we're going to be looking at more severe fire conditions in the future,\" Dr Dickman said.\n\n\"Knowing how the native fauna are likely to respond, and how we might help them to respond and adapt to it, is absolutely crucial.\"\n\nHe said coming up with ways to protect threatened species was crucial in the face of climate change.\n\n\"We're in the middle of an extinction crisis,\" Dr Dickman said.\n\n\"We should have been talking about it and doing things for a much longer period than we have.\n\n\"It's overdue and the more we talk about it and the more we act, the better it's going to be for both human communities and for the natural environment.\"",

Those figures showed the lowest emissions output was in 2016.\n\n\"The Pacific is Australia's home and we share the region's responsibilities and challenges -- particularly in addressing the impact of climate change,\" he said.\n\n\"The Government recognises the major challenges that climate change poses to the Pacific and is providing significant support to help build climate and disaster resilience in the region.\"\n\nAustralia was accused of hampering efforts by small island states to get Pacific-wide consensus on their declaration for stronger action on climate change at the Pacific Islands Forum this year. Tongan Prime Minister Akilisi Pohiva was reduced to tears and other Pacific leaders criticised Australia's stance on coal.\n\nThe topic of sea level rise was also highlighted during last night's Q&A in Fiji, where Tuvalu's former Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said he was \"taken aback\" by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who he said was \"expressing views that completely denies that there is climate change already happening in the Pacific\".\n\nA spokesman for Mr Morrison has rejected the claim.\n\nMr Morrison has outlined how $500 million will be redirected from existing aid programs to help build climate and disaster resilience in the Pacific.",

The problem is they are toxic particles.\"\n\nThe GP says regular air pollution from cars and coal-fired power stations is mixing with smoke from the fires.\n\nDr Loo, who's a member of Doctors for the Environment Australia, said the country's health system was not prepared for the health impacts of climate change such as complications caused by rising temperatures and poor air quality.\n\n\"The health sector is going to bear the brunt of the cost,\" she said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Climate change will have a great impact on our health.

        "body": "Some Sydneysiders taking in their washing this morning were faced with an unusual and disturbing sight on their cloths: large flecks of ash.\n\nFor days Sydney's skies have been covered by a haze of smoke produced by ash particles. Now bigger particles have begun descending to the ground as millions of residents find themselves directly beneath smoke plumes from fires on the city fringe.\n\nAs one social media user said: \"It's raining ash\".\n\nThe ash has been landing over the CBD and inner suburbs far from the fires. It's leading to yet another day of terrible air quality, by some accounts the equivalent of smoking 34 cigarettes a day.\n\nThe westerly winds transporting the ash to the city are unusual for this time of year. It's also bringing scorching highs over the next few days, not just to Sydney but Brisbane as well. There's no relief in the west with Perth set to hit 41C this week.\n\nSky News Weather Channel Meteorologist Tom Saunders told news.com.au the white and black particles attaching themselves to socks and shirts, which people have taken to social media to remark on, are the remnant of burnt bush to the west of Sydney.\n\n\"There is definitely ash blowing across Sydney, from a fire blowing south of Blue Mountains.\n\n\"The southern part of Sydney is directly under the smoke plume that's coming from a fire burning just south of Warragamba Dam and blowing east. That explains why there is ash over people's washing.\"\n\nIt may be sadly regular for regional communities, but ash falling in Sydney has turned heads.\n\nThere were 110 bush and grass fires burning in NSW on Wednesday, 45 still to be contained. The fires stretch from the Murray to the Tweed with scores around the Sydney basin.\n\nThe preponderance of smoke particles, soot and ash, are what's measured to judge air quality levels. And if actual chunks of ash are falling to the ground you can guarantee that means it's going to be another stinker of a day when it comes to pollution.\n\nRELATED: Air in parts of Sydney as bad as smoking 34 cigarettes\n\nSydney's west, south and CBD are set to choke through a day of \"hazardous\" air quality. That will be the worst anywhere in New South Wales. But, in contrast, Sydney's north will actually have good air quality today.\n\nThat's all down to the fact that the smoke plume blanketing parts of Sydney, and giving the city an eerie yellow glow, hasn't extended far north of the harbour. There, skies are clear.\n\nRolling 24-hour levels of particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, smaller fine particles that can easily be ingested and are often caused by bushfires, were at 275 in the city. Anything above 200 is in the highest warning category of hazardous. In Liverpool, in the city's south west, levels were at 626 - more than three times what's considered healthy.\n\nLingering smoke could be \"unhealthy for sensitive people and could cause symptoms, especially in people with heart or lung disease\", the state's environment department said.\n\nPersistent westerly winds are the cause of the smoke being so lingering and so heavy in Sydney. These have blown the fires, almost continuously, directly over populated areas. What you want is the opposite - easterlies bring moisture from the Tasman over the city and towards the blazes, damping them down.\n\nThese westerlies are more a sign of winter than summer. But seasonal changes to Australia's climate drivers have come late this year so the Southern Annular Mode, up from the pole, is continuing to influence the weather.\n\n\"The reason we are having these strong winds is the Antarctic vortex which is a temporary anomaly on the typical pattern. As we move deeper into summer the less likely the chance of westerly winds will become,\" said Mr Saunders.\n\nRELATED: Australia summer weather outlook for 2019/2020\n\nThat will mean there will be a lesser chance of winds carrying smoke from specific fires to the west of Sydney into the city. But there's only one thing that will stop the haze and the ash completely, Mr Saunders said.\n\n\"There will be no improvement in air quality, there will be more of the same, until we have seen widespread rain.\"\n\nHEATWAVE CONDITIONS\n\nThat wind is blowing up and down the east coast and will bring hot temperatures to NSW and Queensland tomorrow.\n\nSydney's CBD is facing 33C on Thursday while Penrith, in the west, will hit 36C for two days straight.\n\nThere are heatwave conditions in Brisbane where it isn't looking to dip blow a maximum of 30C for at least the next week. Today, it will be getting to 34C and then rising to 35C on Friday. Ipswich, in the western suburbs, will top out at 41C on Friday and Saturday.\n\nPerth is also sweltering under heatwave conditions. Yesterday it saw it's earliest 40C-plus day of summer ever. It will reach 36C today and then 41C on Friday. Darwin is also hot on 35C all this week.\n\nIt's cooler elsewhere with Canberra expecting a warm rest of the week with temperatures in the mid to late twenties but chilly nights.\n\nMelbourne will see a string of cloudy days reaching a mere 21C but there will be a spike early next week of 34C.\n\nHobart will get to 15C today and 18C on the weekend with showers expected. Adelaide will be on 23C today rising to 27C on Friday but watch out for a scorching Sunday when the South Australian capital will see 37C.",

        "body": "A climate change \"lens\" will now be applied to all major decision made by the government, New Zealand's climate change minister has said, as floods and bushfires wreck havoc around the country in the first week of summer.\n\nMinister James Shaw said cabinet \"routinely\" considers the effects of its decisions on human rights, the Treaty of Waitangi, rural communities, the disability community, and gender.\n\nNow climate change will become a standard part of cabinet's decision-making too, in a week in which the country has being battered by extreme weather events in both the North and South islands.\n\n\"Decisions we take now and in the future about everything from the places we live, to how we get around, to public health, to how we relate to one another will be impacted one way or another by climate change. It's crucial therefore that when we're making big decisions climate change is at the forefront of our minds,\" Shaw said in a statement.\n\nHe said a 'climate impacts assessment' will be mandatory for proposals that are designed to reduce emissions, or which are likely to have an impact on greenhouse emissions greater than 250,000 tonnes a year.\n\nThe Ministry for the Environment has developed a tool that can be used to estimate emissions impacts, and its effectiveness will be reviewed in mid-2020, Shaw said.\n\nPrime minister Jacinda Ardern has called the climate emergency her generation's \"nuclear free moment\" and made tackling it a priority for her coalition government.\n\nLast month cabinet passed the zero-carbon bill, committing to reduce emission to net-zero by 2050. The government has also banned new offshore oil and gas exploration permits, committed to planting a billion trees by 2028, and told farmers to cut emissions by 2025 or face higher taxes.\n\nThe opposition climate change spokesperson, Scott Simpson, said the announcement was a \"well-meaning initiative\" but how it was implemented would be the real test. \"It shouldn't just be another level of bureaucracy for decisions to go through,\" he said.\n\nThe environment ministry said the effects climate change were already being recorded in New Zealand, including sea-level rise, warming ocean temperatures and hotter summers.\n\nLonger-term, the ministry said the country will experience hotter annual temperatures nationwide, more severe weather, coastal erosion due to sea-level rise, increasingly frequent flooding and higher levels of human and animal mortality.",

        "body": "The health impacts of climate crisis-related events have never been more apparent in Australia, with recent catastrophic fire conditions visibly contributing to respiratory and cardiovascular problems. But medical professionals warn that the climate emergency is likely to have a far wider reach.\n\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) put out a climate change and human health position statement this year, recognising the climate crisis as a key public health issue.\n\nThe position statement cites a long list of health effects that could result from higher temperatures and increased heatwaves, bushfires, droughts and storms. These include risk of stroke and heat stress, worsening chronic respiratory, cardiac and kidney conditions, and psychiatric illness.\n\nDr Tim Senior, who works at the Tharawal Aboriginal Corporation in south-west Sydney, is always busy, but the practice has been getting even more traffic lately. Like other GPs across the country, Dr Senior has a front-row seat to the growing impact of the climate crisis on the health of Australians.\n\n\"We've had more people coming in the last few weeks, with the smoke coming down from the bushfires in New South Wales, presenting with coughs, difficulty breathing - more than you'd usually expect,\" he says.\n\n\"I've been aware increasingly of people coming in with symptoms that could be put down to climate change. The other doctors are seeing the same things; we're all seeing that.\"\n\nBrace for impact: it's going to get worse\n\nThe RACGP's concerns are wide ranging, and cover the short and long term. Dr Senior says changing environmental impacts, such as air pollution, water access, and nutrition, will have flow-on effects for people's health.\n\nThere are also concerns specific to different regions.\n\n\"Some GPs in southern Queensland will see more dengue fever coming through,\" Dr Senior says. \"Where I live it might be more Ross River or Barmah Forest virus.\"\n\nThen there are the indirect impacts, such as the effect of drought on food production, resulting in a poorer quality diet. Vulnerable patients, who already struggle to afford adequate housing, heating or cooling, will be the first affected and least able to deal with weather extremes.\n\nThe mental load\n\nDrought, bushfires and floods have been shown to have severe and long-term effects on mental health. They can also make existing problems worse.\n\n\"If you're already struggling for money or work, having other difficulties piled on top - such as drought, going through a flood, or seeing your children get unwell because of the effect of a heatwave - that adds stress,\" Dr Senior says.\n\nInstead of drinking water, \"yellow sludge\" came out of the taps on the day that Dr Senior visited Walgett, a town in northern NSW. Residents had to boil it or wait for bottled supplies.\n\n\"You can imagine the [mental] impact of having to do that for something that we take for granted - it is terrifying.\"\n\nThree states across the east of Australia have seen tighter water restrictions due to the severity of the drought. Photograph: Klae Mcguinness/Getty Images.\n\nBorn into a heating world\n\nOlder Australians, children, and those with pre-existing conditions are likely to feel the health effects of the climate crisis earlier than the general population, but children have the most to lose, according to a report by Doctors for the Environment Australia. Research has found that globally, 88% of disease due to climate change is borne by children under the age of five, the report says.\n\n\"It's hard to get your head around that,\" Dr Senior says. \"They will live through climate change in a way that no other generation has had to. They won't know anything but chaotic climate.\n\n\"And we know from a lot of the research into health inequality that the first five years of life, as well as pregnancy, are crucial in terms of future health. They have a massive impact.\"\n\nManaging your health in a changing environment\n\nDr Senior says GPs understand what communities are going through, because it's affecting them, too. GPs are best placed to help patients understand how changing temperatures and environment can affect their current conditions, or potentially spark new health concerns.\n\n\"We've always been advising behavioural change, and it's based on having a therapeutic relationship with people,\" he says.\n\n\"The behaviours that keep us well - walking more, driving less, eating less meat and less processed food, for example - also protect the environment.\n\n\"Our patients come first, which means our interventions are based on good science and evidence, along with a good understanding of the people we're working with.\"\n\nThat can entail advising individual patients at risk from heat or smoke to stay indoors at particular times, or advocating for those with respiratory illnesses to get better housing (as Dr Senior does).\n\nIt can also mean discussing interventions - such as diet, transport, energy usage, and community initiatives - to limit the effects of the climate crisis.\n\n\"We treat people and then we send them back to the circumstances that made them unwell,\" Dr Senior says, \"but it's much better for all of us if we're able to be kept well.\"\n\nGPs see 84% of the Australian population each year.\n\n\"That's a massive reach. It's a real opportunity to talk about the ways of mitigating climate change, the effects on their health.\"\n\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) is Australia's largest professional general practice organisation - our mission is to improve the health and wellbeing of all people in Australia by supporting GPs, general practice registrars and medical students.",

        "body": "Related Story: Did he say it or not? Defence Chief's climate speech warns of 'serious ramifications' of climate change\n\nAction to address climate change has been left so late that any political response will likely become an international security issue -- and could threaten democracy.\n\nThat's the view of Ole Wæver, a prominent international relations professor at the University of Copenhagen, who also says climate inaction could lead to armed conflict.\n\n\"At some point this whole climate debate is going to tip over,\" he tells RN's Late Night Live.\n\n\"The current way we talk about climate is one side and the other side. One side is those who want to do something, and the other is the deniers who say we shouldn't do anything.\"\n\nHe believes that quite soon, another battle will replace it. Then, politicians that do 'something' will be challenged by critics demanding that policies actually add up to realistic solutions.\n\nWhen decision-makers -- after delaying for so long -- suddenly try to find a shortcut to realistic action, climate change is likely to \"be securitised\".\n\nProfessor Wæver, who first coined the term \"securitisation\", says more abrupt change could potentially threaten democracy.\n\n\"The United Nations Security Council could, in principle, tomorrow decide that climate change is a threat to international peace and security,\" he says.\n\n\"And then it's within their competencies to decide 'and you are doing this, you are doing this, you are doing this, this is how we deal with it'.\"\n\nProfessor Wæver says despite \"overwhelmingly good arguments\" as to why action should be taken on climate change, not enough has been done.\n\nAnd he says that could eventually lead to a greater risk of armed conflict, particularly in unstable political climates.\n\n\"Imagine these kinds of fires that we are seeing happening [in Australia] in a part of Africa or South-East Asia where you have groups that are already in a tense relationship, with different ethnic groups, different religious orientations,\" he says.\n\n\"And then you get events like this and suddenly they are not out of each other's way, they'll be crossing paths, and then you get military conflicts by the push.\"\n\nHe isn't the first expert to warn of the security risks of climate change.\n\nChris Barrie, former Defence Force chief and honorary professor at the ANU's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, wrote in October that \"climate change is a threat multiplier\".\n\n\"It exacerbates the drivers of conflict by deepening existing fragilities within societies, straining weak institutions, reshaping power balances and undermining post-conflict recovery and peacebuilding,\" he wrote.\n\nAnd current Defence chief Angus Campbell has warned that increased incidences of climate change-related natural disasters could stretch the capability of the ADF.\n\nProfessor Wæver argues that delayed action will lead to more drastic measures.\n\n\"The longer we wait, the more abrupt the change has to be,\" he says.\n\n\"So a transformation of our economy and our energy systems that might have been less painful if we had started 20 years ago, 30 years ago.\n\n\"If we have to do that in a very short time, it becomes extremely painful.\n\n\"And then comes the question: can you carry through such painful transformations through the normal democratic system?\"\n\nHe says classifying climate change as a security issue could justify more extreme policy responses.\n\n\"That's what happens when something becomes a security issue, it gets the urgency, the intensity, the priority, which is helpful sometimes, but it also lets the dark forces loose in the sense that it can justify problematic means,\" he says.\n\nThis urgency, he says, could lead to more abrupt action at an international level.\n\n\"If there was something that was decided internationally by some more centralised procedure and every country was told 'this is your emission target, it's not negotiable, we can actually take military measures if you don't fulfil it', then you would basically have to get that down the throat of your population, whether they like it or not,\" he says.\n\n\"A bit like what we saw in southern Europe with countries like Greece and the debt crisis and so on.\n\n\"There were decisions that were made for them and then they just had to have a more or less technocratic government and get it through.\"\n\nBut Mark Howden, director of the ANU's Climate Change Institute, does not see this happening any time soon -- and says it would be counter-productive in the long-term.\n\n\"I wouldn't support that sort of hypothesised action by the UN, because I think solutions to climate change need to be a partnership,\" he says.\n\n\"The way to generate persistent, long-term and positive action is by partnerships, so actually bringing people along, developing a collective vision of what could be, and making climate change not something to fear but something to take sensible decisions over.\n\n\"So for me, taking a security approach -- taking a unilateral, very militaristic, interventionist approach -- would break apart all those positives.\n\n\"It wouldn't necessarily generate partnerships, it wouldn't generate bottom-up action and wouldn't generate innovation.\"\n\nBut, Professor Howden says, there's an \"elevated conversation happening across many different domains\" about climate change in Australia, particularly because of bushfires and droughts.\n\nHe says climate-related disasters create a \"step up in terms of public concern in relation to climate change\" -- whether or not they are linked.\n\n\"Climate-related disasters tend to get people reflecting on their lived experience and the things they value and it raises that level of concern and tends to stay high for an extended period.\"\n\nHe recognises \"we haven't solved this problem\", but says the Paris Agreement -- and the national and international greenhouse gas inventories that support it -- still shows promise. He says \"it is the only global game in town to limit climate change\".\n\nThe 2015 agreement set targets to block global warming at well below 2C, and 1.5C if possible.\n\nBut a recent UN report revealed global fossil fuel output is currently projected to overwhelm these efforts.\n\n\"Everyone knows that those initial commitments aren't adequate to meet the temperature targets, but they're a start,\" Professor Howden says.\n\n\"The key to the effectiveness of the Paris Agreement is the mechanism that ratchets up those commitments over time.\"\n\nProfessor Howden says we should give the Paris Agreement \"a chance to work\" -- and if it does, it will \"take a chunk out\" of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"The big question is: is it going to happen fast enough?\"",

The report said evidence made plain that the president improperly pressured Ukraine to influence the 2020 election, using language that seemed to lay the groundwork for several potential articles of impeachment.\n\nIraqi interpreters who served the Australian defence force say they have been prevented from applying for visas to migrate to Australia. Their work with foreign forces put them in danger, they said, with many of the \"thousands\" of soldiers and police they trained now allegedly associated with militias and able to recognise their faces. They said the Australian embassy directed them to Lebanon or Jordan to apply for visas - a near-impossible personal and financial undertaking for many.\n\nAustralian students' performance in mathematics has fallen to the OECD average, the first time results in one of the three core competencies has done so since international comparisons began in 2000. The Programme for International Student Assessment results, released on Tuesday evening, confirm a continuing long-term decline in Australian students' reading, maths and science skills. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, said the results \"should have alarm bells ringing\".\n\nAustralia\n\nThe 30,000-hectare Currowan bushfire near Batemans Bay has destroyed at least one home and reached the coast on Tuesday evening as NSW prepared for another hot and windy day, with thick smoke continuing to blanket Sydney and surrounding areas.\n\nClimate change is escalating as \"the most significant threat\" to Australia's wet tropics world heritage area, with an update to parliament reporting the outlook for the bioregion is a cause of \"great concern\".\n\nA Young Liberal National party leader has been suspended from the party after he was filmed laughing at a teenager saying Australia should \"stop celebrating a culture that couldn't even invent the bloody wheel\".\n\nLess than 40% of the population will be covered by private health insurance by 2030 unless reforms are made, according to a report from the Grattan Institute.\n\nThe world\n\nKamala Harris has dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. The senator from California started well in the crowded primary field, but in polling terms could not break into the first rank of candidates.\n\nDonald Trump has lashed out at Emmanuel Macron on the first morning of a two-day Nato meeting, saying the French president's description of Nato as brain dead was insulting and a \"very, very nasty statement\". Trump also warned that a trade deal with China could be more than a year away.\n\nThe South Korean pop star and actor Cha In Ha has been found dead at the age of 27, the third young Korean star to die in the space of two months. Cha, who was a member of the K-pop group Surprise U, was found at his home.\n\nThe climate activist Greta Thunberg has arrived in Lisbon after a three-week catamaran voyage across the Atlantic Ocean from the US. The Swedish teenager now plans to head to Spain to attend the UN climate conference in Madrid.\n\nScientists have created artificial neurons that could potentially be implanted into patients to overcome paralysis, restore failing brain circuits and even connect their minds to machines.\n\nRecommended reads\n\nAs bushfires rage, wildlife rescue organisations are feeling the pressure. \"We are completely inundated at the moment,\" says Kristie Newton, a campaign manager for the NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service. While volunteering can be a significant time commitment, there are things anyone in bushfire-affected areas can do to help native animals.\n\nThe high court will this week examine whether Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders can be deported as aliens if they don't hold Australian citizenship. The federal government says they can. But lawyers for two Indigenous men facing removal from the country, backed up by the Victorian state government, say there is another option: non-citizen non-alien.\n\nListen\n\nFatbergs: they're giant balls of filth that clog up our sewers, creating millions of dollars of damage.

        "body": "A \"global tragedy\" is unfolding in New South Wales with almost two million hectares of land already lost to bushfires this season, a nature conservation group has warned.\n\nThe \"monumental bushfires\" are \"changing the course of history for nature\" in New South Wales, according to the Nature Conservation Council, and the government must do more to save its remaining forests.\n\n\"At a time when we've lost so much we need to protect what's left,\" the council said in a campaign launched on Tuesday.\n\nMore than 7000 bushfires have raged across New South Wales since July in what firefighters have described as the \"most challenging bushfire season ever\".\n\nScientists say the size and severity of this year's blazes are \"unprecedented\" and the country is now in \"uncharted territory\".\n\nEvidence of the enormous devastation was laid bare in a report released by The Climate Council this week, which said more than 1.7 million hectares of land had been burned across New South Wales since November.\n\nMore than 10 per cent of the area covered by the state's national parks has also been burned, including 20 per cent of the Blue Mountains world heritage area, according to data obtained by The Guardian.\n\nLast bushfire season, 80,000 hectares of national park was destroyed, it reports.\n\nBut the CEO of the Nature Conservation Council, Chris Gambian, said at least 800,000 hectares had been lost since July this year.\n\nOf particular concern to environmental groups are the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, which stretch along the country's east coast from Newcastle to Brisbane.\n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage-listed rainforests span over 370,000 hectares of land and are home to an extensive list of endangered species.\n\n\"The outstanding geological features displayed around shield volcanic craters and the high number of rare and threatened rainforest species are of international significance for science and conservation,\" the World Heritage Centre says.\n\nNormally the Gondwana Rainforests are too wet to burn, according to the Nature Conservation Council.\n\nBut in a statement posted on its website last month, UNESCO said it was concerned for the rainforests amid the ongoing bushfires.\n\nThe centre said it was working with Australian authorities to determine the \"potential impact of the fires\" on the area and was ready to provide assistance if needed.\n\nThe Climate Council's report also said more than 206 heat records had been broken in just 90 days in Australia, but the worst was yet to come.\n\nRELATED: Ninety heat records broken in just 90 days\n\n\"Queensland and New South Wales have both lost more homes (to bushfire) since August 2019 than in any previous year, with the hottest months of the fire season still to come,\" it said.\n\nThe council warned that both Sydney and Melbourne could experience 50C summer days before the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.\n\n\"We have seen bushfires starting in winter, a heatwave traversing the country in spring, and a prolonged drought. Climate change is influencing all of these things,\" Climate councillor and report author Professor Will Steffen said.\n\nLast month, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia's domestic climate action had no bearing on individual fires raging across the country.\n\n\"To suggest that with just 1.3 per cent of global emissions that Australia doing something differently - more or less - would have changed the fire outcome this season, I don't think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all,\" he told ABC radio.",

        "body": "Climate change is escalating as \"the most significant threat\" to Australia's wet tropics world heritage area, with an update to parliament reporting the outlook for the bioregion is a cause of \"great concern\".\n\nThe grim assessment of the critical north Queensland rainforest region is outlined in an annual snapshot of the protected area prepared by the Wet Tropics Management Authority, which urges greater national and international effort to address the causes of climate change.\n\nThe wet tropics world heritage area spans 450km of tropical north Queensland coastline between Cooktown and Townsville and comprises the world's oldest living rainforests and the largest area of rainforest in Australia.\n\nIt also supports the highest level of biodiversity of any region in Australia, being home to 36% of Australia's mammals, 29% of Australia's frog species, 60% of Australia's butterfly species and 50% of Australia's bird species.\n\nThe agency's two annual reports, one specifically on the state of the world heritage area, both warn that the conservation outlook for the region is deteriorating, with climate change seen as \"likely to result in widespread and substantial ecological change\".\n\n\"Climate change is escalating as the most significant threat to the wet tropics long-term outlook, including changes to the distribution and density of endemic and specialised cool adapted rainforest species,\" the report says.\n\n\"Changes to endemic and specialised cool adapted rainforest species distribution and density having already been recorded - and some somber predictions of modelled effects are already being realised.\"\n\nThe agency reports that after receiving new evidence of the \"accelerated decline of unique, endemic wet tropics animals\", such as the lemuroid ringtail possum which is at risk of imminent extinction, the board released a climate impact statement and a 10-point plan for climate adaptation.\n\n\"The board's call is for urgent action and investment to improve resilience and protection to give the area the best chance of withstanding extreme events and climate impacts, pending a reduction in global emissions,\" it said.\n\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\nThe snapshot also warns that \"more extreme and unplanned bushfires\" will occur in the future, posing a significant threat to the old-growth rainforest.\n\n\"Although not directly attributable to climate change, our rapidly warming climate, driven by human activities, is exacerbating every risk factor for more frequent and intense bushfires,\" the report says.\n\nOther threats reported by the authority include the damage being inflicted by invasive species, with feral pigs, yellow crazy ants, invasive weeds and pathogens such as myrtle rust all having an impact.\n\nFunding cuts are also listed as a threat, with the authority reporting a \"significant decline in research and monitoring of the property\".\n\n\"Despite previous historical investment in research in the area, research funding has significantly declined over recent years,\" the report says.\n\nUnder the current National Environmental Science Program (2015-2021) commonwealth research funding investment into wet tropics rainforests was not a priority.\n\nThe final threat listed by the agency is the increased demand for infrastructure like roads, dams and energy supply, \"caused by a growing urban population and tourist visitor numbers, distributing visitation across a wider area\".\n\nThe wet tropics area, which was declared protected in 1988, was also examined in 2017 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature which carries out regular assessments of the world's 241 natural world heritage sites.\n\nThe 2017 Outlook Report reported that the wet tropics region was under direct threat from \"invasive plants, animals and diseases, and the high risk posed by the predicted impacts of climate change\".\n\nThe authority is concerned that the threat to the region's ecology could also threaten the world heritage listing, which would have a knock-on effect to the Queensland economy.\n\n\"Climate change is one of the most significant threats to the area and is likely to result in widespread and substantial ecological change,\" the report says.\n\n\"This change will impact the biodiversity values underpinning the world heritage listing of the area and has the potential to affect the region's economy.\"\n\nA spokesman for environment minister Sussan Ley said the wet tropics was an \"incredibly important area and one that receives significant funding.\"\n\n\"In addition to its annual funding, the government has further invested $9m in crazy ant eradication and the formation of a Tourism Destination Development Plan to enhance opportunities for Indigenous cultural tourism enterprises and grow appropriate eco-tourism.\n\n\"We will continue to work with Queensland to protect this very important place.\"",

Last year, greenhouse gas emissions hit a record high.\n\n\"At the negotiators level, they are working to try and close any loopholes to make sure that you have a strong agreement that works,\" said Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser on climate change at the World Wildlife Fund UK.\n\n\"We are hoping it will all be completed here in Madrid.\"\n\nExisting commitments fall far short of the kind of radical action to transform energy, transport, heating and agricultural systems that scientists say is needed to steer the world off its current course towards disastrous levels of warming.",

        "body": "Related Story: 'What does it take?': WA Police took hours to arrive at scene of four bushfire deaths, court told\n\nA West Australian coroner investigating the deaths of four people on the state's south coast says climate change is undoubtably intensifying bushfires nationwide, dismissing all political claims to the contrary.\n\nFarmer Kym Curnow and farm workers Thomas Butcher, Julia Kohrs-Lichte and Anna Winther died in their vehicles on November 17, 2015, during enormous, out-of-control bushfires near Esperance, about 700km east of Perth.\n\nThe coroner investigating the deaths, Sarah Linton, handed down her findings on Tuesday, following a coronial inquest in March.\n\nThey include 12 recommendations, many of which would require significant government funding.\n\nThe coroner also took the chance on Tuesday to say bushfires throughout the country were being exacerbated by climate change.\n\n\"Despite the rhetoric of many politicians today, who would have us believe that climate change is not the cause of increasing bushfires in Australia, I am satisfied from the evidence before me that the climate is changing and the timing, number, duration and severity of fires in this country is increasing, in part as a result of climate change,\" she said.\n\n\"The recent devastating bushfires in Queensland and New South Wales, that have already caused a number of deaths and destroyed vast areas of land, livestock and native animals, are a telling example of the accuracy of the BOM and CSIRO predictions.\n\n\"These events are occurring earlier and earlier in the fire season.\"\n\nAmong the coroner's recommendations was that the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) fund a career fire and rescue service station, made up of about 20 firefighters and a station officer, for the Esperance and Ravensthorpe community.\n\nThe United Professional Firefighters Union of Western Australia had suggested this would improve emergency response times, training and increase the DFES presence in the region.\n\nHowever, this recommendation has already been ruled out by the State Emergency Services Minister Francis Logan.\n\nFunding was another issue highlighted by the coroner -- who was told of the \"complete imbalance\" between the money spent on bushfire response compared to bushfire prevention work.\n\n\"The evidence put before me in this inquest, and the recurring theme of the submissions, is that the lack of any long-term, appropriate funding for fire mitigation in the Esperance region has created a major bushfire risk by allowing fuel loads to increase dramatically and firebreak maintenance to fall behind,\" she said.\n\nWhile she did not state which specific funding stream should be tapped into, she said the State Government should provide a decade's worth of funding to create firebreaks and strategic fire exit tracks on unallocated crown land in the Esperance region.\n\nShe also called for the Esperance region to secure two more light tanker appliances, and for the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions to allocate funding for earthmoving equipment and a full-time position, allowing more fire mitigation work to be carried out in the region.\n\nMs Linton also heard a lack of water bombers was a major issue when it came to fighting the fires.\n\nWhile the Shire of Esperance now has an updated policy to try and ensure water bombers are available -- they will be sent from Albany if extreme weather is forecast -- the coroner noted there were only two airstrips available for water bombers in the shire, with none in its north-east or north-west.\n\nShe recommended that airstrips in the north-west corner of the Esperance Shire be reviewed, and ones that can facilitate water bombers be identified.\n\nShe also called for about $800,000 to be allocated basing fixed-wing water bombers in the Wheatbelt and Esperance regions for the full fire season.\n\nCoroner Linton also believed the official bushfire season in Esperance should be updated, to reflect the impact of climate change.\n\n\"This would assist in ensuring water bombing aircraft are in place when needed. It would also ensure that volunteer or community training is completed earlier,\" she said.\n\nA lack of communications was also a major issue for those fighting the 2015 fires -- as it was more recently in the March 2019 Esperance bushfires -- and the coroner called for a new repeater station in north-west Esperance to help communications during an emergency.\n\nIn concluding her report, Ms Linton reiterated her concern about rising bushfire risks and called on the State Government to act.\n\n\"The people of Esperance, the staff of DFES and DPaW, and many others, have all contributed to the outcomes in this finding,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope their work is not in vain and the State Government gives due regard to what the people who actually fight these fires say they need to save lives in the future when the next bushfire inevitably rages in Esperance.\"\n\nMinister for Emergency Services Francis Logan said since the Esperance bushfires a \"great deal of progress has been made\", such as increased DFES support to the region, pre-deploying water bombers to the region during extreme weather, basing a council emergency services manager in the DFES Esperance office and creating an interagency bushfire mitigation working group.\n\n\"I will consider the recommendations of the coroner carefully before responding fully, but it is important to state now that a career fire station is not a consideration,\" he said.\n\n\"This Government is instead putting unprecedented investment into bushfire mitigation as well as providing financial support for local governments to identify and treat their own bushfire risks.\n\n\"My sympathies again go out to the Curnow family as well as the Butcher, Winther and Kohrs-Lichte families. It was a terrible event that I hope will never be repeated.\"\n\nThe Department of Fire and Emergency Services, where many of the coroner's recommendations are targeted, is still reviewing the report.\n\n\"My thoughts are with the Curnow, Butcher, Winther and Kohrs-Lichte families and the Esperance community,\" DFES Commissioner Darren Klemm AFSM said.\n\n\"DFES, its partners and the entire Esperance community are united in our commitment to make sure the events of the Esperance 2015 fires are never repeated.\n\n\"Together with the community, we have done a huge amount of work since 2015 and this work will continue.\"\n\n\"We now look forward to reading it in detail and working with our partners, volunteers and the community on moving forward from here.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions also said it was reviewing the report and would work closely with the Department of Fire and Emergency Services and the Shire of Esperance to consider how to address the recommendations.\n\nThe Shire of Esperance was contacted for comment.",

But then it really heats up with the mercury tipped to rise to 27C on Saturday, then 35C on Sunday and 37C on Monday.\n\nIt coincides with the release of a report by The Climate Council, which says more than 206 heat records have been broken in just 90 days this year, including record-highest temperatures in 87 locations in Australia.\n\nMost dramatically, the peak day in Adelaide is on average now 4.3C higher in 1981-2011 compared with 1950-1980.\n\n\"We have seen bushfires starting in winter, a heatwave traversing the country in spring, and a prolonged drought. Climate change is influencing all of these things,\" Climate councillor and report author Professor Will Steffen said.\n\nLast month, as the spring temperature soared into the 40s, a large stubble fire fanned by strong winds threatened Port Lincoln.\n\nTwo people, including a firefighter, suffered minor injuries and two houses and six sheds were destroyed at Duck Ponds, in the first major inferno of the season.\n\nThe jacarandas are also providing the perfect purple-blue backdrop for Brianna, from The Models, to showcase a yellow gown by Grace Kandelaars.\n\nMs Kandelaars is in her third year of a Bachelor of Creative Arts Fashion dual award degree offered by TAFE SA and Flinders University.\n\nHer work and designs by other TAFE SA students will be paraded on Friday at An Evening of Fashion at The Ellington, Hackney.

        "body": "The term 'heatwave' gets thrown about during Perth's warmer months when temperatures climb into uncomfortable territory, but the city has actually escaped the past three summers without one.\n\nThe last time WA's Department of Health declared an official heatwave was in February 2016, when Perth's maximum temperature surpassed 40 degrees Celsius for four days in a row.\n\nThe department defines a heatwave as three or more consecutive days when the forecast minimum and maximum temperatures average at least 32C.\n\nHeatwaves are Australia's deadliest natural hazard, killing more people than cyclones, floods and bushfires combined.\n\nAccording to data from research centre Risk Frontiers, extreme heat accounted for more than half of all listed deaths attributed to natural hazards from 1900 to 2011 nationwide.\n\nBut WA's chief health officer Andy Robertson said its effects were often underestimated.\n\n\"Various communities prepare very well for some of the other disasters, for example in the Kimberley and the Pilbara people are well prepared for cyclones ... it's a similar situation in bushfire-prone areas,\" he said.\n\n\"We probably don't plan as well for heatwaves and part of that is we feel that, 'hey, we're West Australians, we're fine, the heat is not going to hurt us, we're used to the heat'.\"\n\nDr Robertson said heat-related hospital admissions generally fell into one of two categories.\n\n\"One is the direct effects of heat, so people get heat exhaustion and heat stroke,\" he said.\n\n\"But the more insidious effect is on people who have chronic disease, or the very young and the very old who have limited ability to adjust. They become exhausted over that period of time and what we see is an exacerbation of chronic diseases.\n\n\"So we see more [people with] renal disease, heart disease, respiratory disease and they end up in hospital and a number of those may unfortunately die.\"\n\nBut it is not just those with chronic diseases and the young and old who are vulnerable. The list is extensive.\n\n\"There are other groups that include pregnant women, people who work outdoors, some of the visitors and new arrivals to Australia who may not be used to our climate and who may make poor decisions around being out in the middle of the day or exercising during the day,\" Dr Robertson said.\n\n\"Then there are those who for various reasons aren't able to access air conditioning or other cooling, so the homeless or those who may be socio-economically disadvantaged.\"\n\nPerth's most severe heat event was in February 1955 when 30 people died.\n\nIn 2012 heatwaves were gazetted as a hazard under WA's Emergency Management Regulations, and the Department of Health was assigned as the agency responsible for monitoring them.\n\nIt then developed its current heatwave threshold of three consecutive days where the highest and lowest temperatures each day average at least 32C. This was met each summer from 2011-12 to 2015-16, but not since.\n\n\"We've been lucky over the last [few] years in the metropolitan area, we've had hot days but then it's tended to cool down,\" Dr Robertson said.\n\n\"That ability to have a couple of cool days in-between is actually critical because we often don't see [heat-related] cases on day one, we see them on day three or four because of the cumulative effect of heat and not being able to cool down.\"\n\nIn Perth, heatwaves are generated by high pressure systems which stall in the Great Australian Bight for a number of days.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere, winds rotate anticlockwise around highs.\n\nHighs move across Australia from west to east, but on occasion a stubborn high will park in the bight, pushing hot, dry air from the outback onto Perth in east or north-easterly winds for a number of days.\n\nBureau of Meteorology (BOM) spokesman Neil Bennett said the lack of heatwaves for the past few summers could be attributed to the rapid movement of the highs from west to east, although it is unclear what is driving it.\n\n'What we think has happened over the last couple of years is that the highs themselves have continued their track from west to east, south of the continent,\" he said.\n\n\"But instead of stalling or slowing down in the bight, they've continued to push through, so we don't see the prolonged build up of heat.\"\n\nBut that could be about to change, with BOM's latest climate outlook suggesting most of Australia is in for a hot season.\n\nIt predicts daytime temperatures from December to February are very likely to be warmer than average for all of Australia, with the exception of western Tasmania.",

        "body": "Related Story: After a bushfire burnt 300 power poles, Horizon became the first utility company to kick customers off the grid\n\nLocated in Victoria's remote high country, Licola Wilderness Village has become the first Victorian town to go completely off grid with solar energy.\n\nLocated 50 kilometres from the nearest electricity grid, Licola has historically been powered by diesel generators.\n\nLicola Wilderness Village CEO and operations manager Tony Davis said the move to solar power had reduced energy-production costs and carbon emissions by 90 per cent.\n\n\"Licola is very much a world's best practice now for what is called a micro grid,\" Mr Davis said.\n\n\"We're a small, totally self-sufficient, totally off-grid system.\"\n\nLicola is a recreational camping town, which pumps all its water from the nearby Macalister River.\n\nMr Davis said the rising costs of diesel had meant the camp was spending $135,000 a year to keep the generators going.\n\n\"The energy we produce via our solar systems can power the entire town,\" he said.\n\n\"It would be very easy to replicate in many small communities that are remote and off the grid across the country.\"\n\nLicola is an abandoned sawmill town. In 1969, the Lions Clubs of Victoria and New South Wales bought the town facilities for $20,000.\n\nThe club bought the town to create a recreational camping village for disadvantaged students. The idea was originally inspired by similar summer camps in the USA.\n\nThe village has 16 cabins, 270 beds, staff quarters, a swimming pool, a sports stadium and a church, and hosts about 1,500 children each year.\n\nThe camp is funded by a combination of money raised from Lions clubs across the state, bequests and the hiring out of the village.\n\nThe cost of diesel had increased the costs of power so much that running the camp was becoming unsustainable.\n\nThe solar panel system involves 600 solar panels positioned to capture different angles of the sun throughout the day.\n\nThe solar energy is then harnessed into a pair of 37-tonne batteries stored in two large shipping containers.\n\nAn Australian-designed inverter converts the power to 240 volts.\n\nProject solar engineer Peter McKernan said the camp hoped to cover the costs of installing the solar system in seven years.\n\n\"When I first started in solar, we paid $13 a watt. Solar systems now cost around 46 cents a watt, it's made it so affordable,\" he said.\n\n\"Things like this are now competitive with coal generation and are now in fact cheaper than diesel generation.\"\n\nAs Licola is located at the base of a mountainous valley, diesel generators will remain in place as a backup source of energy generation over winter and periods of low sunlight.\n\n\"From Lions' perspective, the most important thing is that we run it as a camp for disadvantaged children, children with disabilities, seniors who like to come up here as a group and the general public,\" said Noreen Carr, who has been a member of the Licola Wilderness Village board of directors for the past 17 years.\n\nThe annual savings on diesel expenditure will enable the Lions Club to expand the camp, run more programs throughout the year, improve accessible facilities for children, seniors and the general public.\n\n\"We put these fantastic air conditioners and heaters in all the cabins and halls,\" village board secretary Brad Underhill said.\n\n\"We're now going to be able to have kids up here in the middle of winter because we're going to have these savings.\"",

New survey sees huge spike in concern over climate change\n\nThe United Nations says the world must reduce overall emissions by 7.6% every year over the next decade to have a high chance of staying under 1.5℃ warming this century.\n\nThe 1.5℃ limit is at the upper end of the Paris goal; warming beyond this is likely to lead to catastrophic impacts, including near-total destruction of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nPresently, emissions reduction targets of nations signed up to Paris put Earth on track for a 3.2℃ increase.\n\nA global carbon market\n\nParties will debate the mechanism in the Paris agreement allowing emissions trading between nations, and via the private sector.\n\nSuch mechanisms could lower the global cost of climate mitigation, because emissions reduction in some nations is cheaper than in others. But there are concerns the trading regime may lack transparency and accountability.\n\nRead more: Double counting of emissions cuts may undermine Paris climate deal\n\nAmong the risks are that emissions cuts are \"double counted\" - meaning both the buying and selling nation count the cuts towards their targets, undermining the aims of the agreement.\n\nHelp for vulnerable nations\n\nSmall island states say COP25 is the last chance to take decisive action on global emissions reduction.\n\nFossil fuel burning in the developing world is largely responsible for the carbon dioxide that drives global warming. Developing nations are particularly vulnerable to the loss and damage caused by climate change.\n\nParties will discuss whether an international mechanism designed to assess and compensate for such damage is effective.\n\nDeveloping nations are expected to contribute to the Green Climate Fund to help poorer nations cope with and mitigate climate change. Some 27 nations contributed US$9.78 billion in the last funding round.\n\nSome nations have indicated they will not contribute further, including Australia, which says it already helps Pacific nations through its overseas aid program.\n\nArguments about cost\n\nNations opposed to adopting stronger emissions reduction targets often argue the costs of decarbonising energy sectors, and economies as a whole, are too high.\n\nHowever, recent cost benefit analysis has found not taking action on climate change will be expensive in the long run.\n\nRealisation is also growing that the cost of emissions reduction activities has been overestimated in the past. In Australia, prominent economist Ross Garnaut recently said huge falls in the cost of equipment for solar and wind energy has created massive economic opportunity, such as future manufacturing of zero-emission iron and aluminium.\n\nThe shift in the cost-balance means nations with low ambition will find it difficult to argue against climate mitigation on cost grounds.\n\nAustralia's position at Madrid\n\nAt the Paris talks, Australia pledged emissions reduction of 26-28% by 2030, based on 2005 levels. The Morrison government has indicated it will not ramp up the goal.\n\nAbout 68 nations said before COP25 they will set bolder emissions reduction targets, including Fiji, South Africa and New Zealand. This group is expected to exert pressure on laggard nations.\n\nThis pressure has already begun: France has reportedly insisted that a planned free trade deal between Australia and the European Union must include \"highly ambitious\" action on climate change.\n\nRead more: A hot and dry Australian summer means heatwaves and fire risk ahead\n\nThe Climate Action Tracker says Australia is not contributing its fair share towards the global 1.5℃ commitment. Australia is also ranked among the worst performing G20 nations on climate action.\n\nThe Madrid conference takes place amid high public concern over climate change. Thousands of Australians took part in September's climate strikes and the environment has reportedly surpassed healthcare, cost of living and the economy as the top public concern.\n\nClimate change has already arrived in the form of more extreme weather and bushfires, water stress, sea level rise and more. These effects are a small taste of what is to come if negotiations in Madrid fail to deliver.\n\nJohanna Nalau, Samid Suliman and Tim Cadman contributed to this article.",

        "body": "The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nIt's well established that unsustainable human activity is damaging the health of the planet. The way we use Earth threatens our future and that of many animals and plants. Species extinction is an inevitable end point.\n\nIt's important that the loss of Australian nature be quantified accurately. To date, putting an exact figure on the number of extinct species has been challenging. But in the most comprehensive assessment of its kind, our research has confirmed that 100 endemic Australian species living in 1788 are now validly listed as extinct.\n\nAlarmingly, this tally confirms that the number of extinct Australian species is much higher than previously thought.\n\nThe most precise tally yet\n\nCounts of extinct Australian species vary. The federal government's list of extinct plants and animals totals 92. However 20 of these are subspecies, five are now known to still exist in Australia and seven survive overseas - reducing the figure to 60.\n\nAn RMIT/ABC fact check puts the figure at 46.\n\nThe states and territories also hold their own extinction lists, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature keeps a global database, the Red List.\n\nOur research collated these separate listings. We excluded species that still exist overseas, such as the water tassel-fern. We also excluded some species that, happily, have been rediscovered since being listed as extinct, or which are no longer recognised as valid species (such as the obscure snail Fluvidona dulvertonensis).\n\nWe concluded that exactly 100 plant and animal species are validly listed as having become extinct in the 230 years since Europeans colonised Australia:\n\n38 plants, such as the magnificent spider-orchid 1 seaweed species 34 mammals including the thylacine and pig-footed bandicoot 10 invertebrates including a funnel-web spider, beetles and snails 9 birds, such as the paradise parrot 4 frogs, including two species of the bizarre gastric-brooding frog which used its stomach as a womb 3 reptiles including the Christmas Island forest skink 1 fish, the Pedder galaxias.\n\nOur tally includes three species listed as extinct in the wild, with two of these still existing in captivity.\n\nThe mammal toll represents 10% of the species present in 1788. This loss rate is far higher than for any other continent over this period.\n\nThe 100 extinctions are drawn from formal lists. But many extinctions have not been officially registered. Other species disappeared before their existence was recorded. More have not been seen for decades, and are suspected lost by scientists or Indigenous groups who knew them best. We speculate that the actual tally of extinct Australian species since 1788 is likely to be about ten times greater than we derived from official lists.\n\nAnd biodiversity loss is more than extinctions alone. Many more Australian species have disappeared from all but a vestige of their former ranges, or persist in populations far smaller than in the past.\n\nDating the losses\n\nDating of extinctions is not straightforward. For a few Australian species, such as the Christmas Island forest skink, we know the day the last known individual died. But many species disappeared without us realising at the time.\n\nOur estimation of extinction dates reveals a largely continuous rate of loss - averaging about four species per decade.\n\nContinuing this trend, in the past decade, three Australian species have become extinct - the Christmas Island forest skink, Christmas Island pipistrelle and Bramble Cay melomys - and two others became extinct in the wild.\n\nThe extinctions occurred over most of the continent. However 21 occurred only on islands smaller than Tasmania, which comprise less than 0.5% of Australia's land mass.\n\nThis trend, repeated around the world, is largely due to small population sizes and vulnerability to newly introduced predators.\n\nWe must learn from the past\n\nThe 100 recognised extinctions followed the loss of Indigenous land management, its replacement with entirely new land uses and new settlers introducing species with little regard to detrimental impacts.\n\nIntroduced cats and foxes are implicated in most mammal extinctions; vegetation clearing and habitat degradation caused most plant extinctions. Disease caused the loss of frogs and the accidental introduction of an Asian snake caused the recent loss of three reptile species on Christmas Island.\n\nThe causes have changed over time. Hunting contributed to several early extinctions, but not recent ones. In the last decade, climate change contributed to the extinction of the Bramble Cay melomys, which lived only on one Queensland island.\n\nThe prospects for some species are helped by legal protection, Australia's fine national reserve system and threat management. But these gains are subverted by the legacy of previous habitat loss and fragmentation, and the ongoing damage caused by introduced species.\n\nOur own population increase is causing further habitat loss, and new threats such as climate change bring more frequent and intense droughts and bushfires.\n\nEnvironment laws have demonstrably failed to stem the extinction crisis. The national laws are now under review, and the federal government has indicated protections may be wound back.\n\nBut now is not the time to weaken environment laws further. The creation of modern Australia has come at a great cost to nature - we are not living well in this land.\n\nThe study on which this article is based was also co-authored by Andrew Burbidge, David Coates, Rod Fensham and Norm McKenzie.",
