        "body": "Why worse wildfires? The short answer is more humans cause more wildfire ignitions in altered landscapes. Since 1970, California's population doubled, adding 20 million people. As more human habitat was developed, the increasingly disturbed landscape quickly became covered in easily ignitable invasive grasses (see part 1). To protect human habitat, fires were suppressed and ground fuels increased. Development also expanded a vulnerable electric grid. Furthermore, more people increased the probability of careless fires and more innocent accidents. And sadly, a larger population added more arsonists.\n\nDuring a typically warm and dry July day, a rancher was innocently driving a stake into the ground to plug a wasp's nest. Surrounded by dry grass, the hammer's spark ignited a devastating inferno named the Ranch Fire. Despite sensationalist's hype, global warming had not made the grass drier. Grass becomes highly combustible in just a few hours of dry weather. And like most of northern California, there has been no warming trend for maximum summertime tempertures. Based on Western Regional Climate Center data, maximum summer temperatures in the Mendocino area had cooled by 3°F since the 1930s. The rapidly spreading Ranch Fire soon merged with a different fire to form the Mendocino Complex Fire, California's largest documented fire.\n\nSimilarly, a highway accident sparked roadside grasses that kindled northern California's 7th largest fire, the Carr Fire.\n\nCareless fires cannot be considered accidents and offenders should be held accountable. A hunter's illegal and improperly attended campfire caused the August 2013 Rim Fire, centered around Yosemite National Park. It was California's 5th largest fire.\n\nGovernments and utility companies should likewise be held accountable for carelessly maintaining our electric grids. An electric spark ignited California's deadliest fire, the Camp Fire which destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. As a 2018 research paper estimates, \"Since the year 2000 there've been a half-million acres burned due to powerline-ignited fires, which is five times more than we saw in the previous 20 years.\"\n\nMore disturbing is the number of fires started by arson. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, nationally, as in California, one in every five brush, grass, or forest fires since 2007 were intentionally set. Arsonists have been recently charged for some of California's 2019 fires. Arson accounted for 55% of Kentucky's fires and is the leading cause of Florida's fires. Because arson is so difficult to prove, arson statistics are probably underestimated. So, experts in Australia combine arson and \"suspicious\" fires to argue half of Australia's fires were likely intentionally set. That means each year 31,000 Australian bushfires are intentionally ignited. And as in the American west, Australia's bush fires have been increasingly fueled by invasive grasses like Buffel grass.\n\nWildfires caused by natural lightning ignitions, peak during the summer months of July and August, and become virtually non-existent in the autumn and winter. In contrast, human ignitions have created year-long fire seasons. Counter-intuitively, California experiences the most dangerous fire weather during the cooler and wetter seasons. As seasonally cold air settles in over the high mountain deserts in autumn and winter, episodes of high winds, known as the Santa Ana and Diablo winds, flow downslope. Sinking air warms 5°F for every 1000-foot drop in elevation so these downslope winds can raise lowland temperatures 25°F in just a few hours. That warming causes relative humidity to fall, so these winds rapidly suck moisture out of whatever vegetation it passes over. In combination with faster spreading embers, fires burn 2 to 3 times more area during high wind events.\n\nUnder natural conditions, seasonally extreme winds never coincided with the season of abundant lightning. But due to human ignitions there has been an increased probability of more ignitions occurring during strong cool-weather winds. California's 2nd biggest fire, the Thomas fire, was ignited in December by a downed power line during high winds. The third largest fire, the Cedar Fire was ignited in October by a lost hunter who carelessly lit a signal fire. California's deadliest fire, the Camp Fire, was ignited by a powerline and fiercely spread due to a November high wind event.\n\nClimate change does not ignite fires. Climate change does not affect how quickly dead grasses and bushes can dry. Climate change may affect the winds, but any warming, natural or human, would reduce those extreme winds. Regards California's worst fires, a US Geological Survey's wildfire expert states, \"Some will argue that it's climate change, but there is no evidence that it is. It's the fact that somebody ignites a fire during an extreme [wind] event.\"",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com\n\nA woman stranded in the Australian outback for nearly two weeks was miraculously found alive Sunday -- even as rescue efforts continued in the remote region for the 52-year-old's two friends who remained unaccounted for.\n\nThe Northern Territory Police said in a news release that Tamra McBeath-Riley was found after a vehicle the trio were traveling in was discovered in a riverbed southwest of Alice Springs. The group had left Alice Springs on Nov. 19 before the vehicle became bogged down in the riverbed.\n\nPolice Superintendent Pauline Vicary said at a news conference that McBeath-Riley found water about 1 mile north of the car.\n\n\"Sensibly she appears to have stayed where the water is and has been drinking that, and that's probably what kept her going,\" Vicary said.\n\nAUSTRALIAN FIREFIGHTER ACCUSED OF ARSON AMID BUSHFIRE CRISIS, POLICE SAY\n\nAn air search continued Monday for McBeath-Riley's friends -- Claire Hockridge, 46, and Phu Tran, 40 -- who reportedly left the waterhole to seek help.\n\nMcBeath-Riley said during a Monday news conference that on Thursday her friends began the 12-mile journey to reach a nearby highway, planning to avoid the desert heat -- which came close to 104 Fahrenheit in recent days -- by walking at night and carrying whatever water they could find.\n\n\"We tried many times to try to get out, but just couldn't get out, so ventured forth to try and find some shelter and some water,\" she said. \"The river was just too large, we couldn't get out.\"\n\nDuring the day, the group dug a hole underneath the car to stay cool and then slept in the vehicle at night, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. During that time period, the trio survived on six liters of water, 10 cans of iced vodka, a packet of biscuits and some beef noodles.\n\nAfter running out of supplies, they left a note on the car and made their way to the watering hole.\n\nMcBeath-Riley said she decided to stay at the waterhole with her Staffordshire terrier because she did not think the dog would survive a walk to the Stuart Highway, which connects Australia's north and south coasts. The group of women did not know if anyone was looking for them.\n\n\"When the helicopter found me, I thought that Claire and Phu had reached the highway,\" she told reporters. \"That was my immediate thought. So to find that's not the case is worrying.\"\n\nOfficials said McBeath-Riley was treated in an Alice Springs hospital for dehydration and exposure after she was found late Sunday. Her dog's status was not immediately clear.\n\nAUSTRALIAN ROBBERS' REPEATED FAILURE IN ATM SMASH-AND-GRAB CAUGHT ON CAMERA\n\nPolice said Monday that rescue efforts have \"ramped up,\" with two helicopters covering 14 square miles from the Stuart Highway, the general area where it is believed the pair may be. Vicary said that so far searchers had only found one set of footprints.\n\n\"It's quite a diverse terrain,\" she told reporters. \"There's sandy dunes, there's hard clay, there's areas of dense trees, but there are also rocks and ranges in the area.\"\n\nA local cattle rancher played a key role in saving McBeath-Riley, telling police he spotted tire tracks in an area that hadn't been searched.\n\n\"As a result of that information, we were able to locate the vehicle and then from there they have followed some of the other tracks and have located her,\" Vicary said.",
